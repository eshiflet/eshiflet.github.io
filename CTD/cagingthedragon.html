<h2>Publisher's Note</h2>
<p class="msonormal"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><span class="calibre10">On July 16, 1945
the first nuclear explosion, the Trinity test, took place in the Nevada desert. It was an
atmospheric detonation and was highly successful, releasing radiation into the air that
will forever be recorded in our planet's geological history. 
During the next seventeen years over 200 above ground tests were conducted by the United States,
in addition to over 200 above ground tests by the Soviet Union.
It became obvious that atmospheric testing was a health risk because of the
dangerous radioactive byproducts being detected around the world,
many thousands of miles away from the test sites. In 1963 the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty 
was signed by the United States, Soviet Union and United Kingdom
agreeing to limit testing to underground explosions and contain
any radioactive byproducts within the border of the country conducting the test. This
effectively meant that underground nuclear explosions could not leak into the atmosphere,
a very difficult requirement to meet.
</span></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><span class="calibre10">This book is a history of the design and implementation
of the United States' underground nuclear test program told as a first person narrative by the people who
actually did the work. The successes and failures of these tests are still affecting us today.
As is often quoted, every breath of air you breathe includes a
molecule from Caesar’s last breath. Even more so, every breath you take includes radioactive
byproducts from the nuclear tests described here. The people in this book understood this and did everything
within their scientific, engineering and budgetary power to contain the radioactive byproducts.
</span></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><span class="calibre10">I did not write this book or capture the narrative of
the people working on this project, I merely converted it to a modern electronic format for easy
reading, studying and sharing because I think it should be. It is an important part of the story of people
like you and me trying to control the most powerful force of nature we know of.
</span></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><span class="calibre10">Since this book is an original work by the United States 
government, it is part of the public domain. The original book contained poor quality photographs that were 
not captured in this electronic edition. If it's possible to find a source of the photos with acceptable quality,
I'll update this on-line document.

<h2>Preface</h2>
<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Robert Brownlee, in a talk given at the Monterey Containment Symposium on August 26, 1981, said:</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">It has
been said that there is no such thing as history, only biography. Assuming this
to be true, a description of the evolution of containment would contain the story
of the people involved - their experiments, beliefs, motivations, successes,
failures, foibles, and idiosyncrasies. We might then be able to understand our
current faith and practice, and their origins, in a far better way.</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">Even
for the earliest moments of containment of under-ground nuclear tests, when the
number of individuals involved in the subject was very few, the complexity of
the subject, and the parallel and relatively independent pursuits of Los Alamos
and Livermore, make a retrieval of biographical knowledge quite impossible.</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">In that context, this
book is an attempt to approach that impossibility. It has been my pleasure to
have had the opportunity to talk with people I know who played a role in the
development of our current faith and practice. This book is really theirs, and
that is shown in the extensive quotations from people who have spent much of
their professional careers dealing with the truly difficult problems
encountered. This book does not deal with the formulae and the mathematics, the
charts and graphs that make up the structure of the scientific and engineering
practice of the containment of underground nuclear explosives. Those things can
be found in the documents and reports written by many of the individuals who
have worked in the field during the past thirty-five years or so.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Here there are only
the recollections, memories, opinions, and stories of some of those many
people. Recollections can be faulty, memories fade, opinions change, and
stories often become better in the telling, but taken as a whole they may
convey something of how we came to be where we are in the containment world.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">One regret I have is
that the quoted printed word does not capture the emotional content of the
spoken word - the humor, satire, frustration, sincerity that I heard during
these talks that we had. All are muted in a quotation on the printed page. The
inflection of a single word can change the way a statement is to be taken, but
how to convey that? The only way I know to attempt it is to give some brief
background on each of the people, in their own words. That doesn't have to do
directly with containment, but it does have to do with perhaps putting the
statements of that person in a personal context.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">As for the context of
myself, I went in 1952 from being a newly graduated graduate student who had
done his thesis work at the U. C. Radiation Laboratory, to work with Herb York
on what he initially described to me, somewhat vaguely, as a "small
project." I somehow got the impression that it would be in Berkeley, and
would deal with controlled fusion as a source of power, and indeed that was
what I started to do. A few months later I had moved to Livermore with my
family, and by then I was aware that the "small project" was a second
nuclear weapons design Laboratory. Nine years later the Lawrence Livermore
Radiation Laboratory had a staff of perhaps 5000 people, and I became involved
with nuclear test work.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Since that time in
1961 I have been associated with the test program of the United States in
various capacities. First as the Division Leader of L Division, the people at
Livermore responsible for the design and fielding of the diagnostic
measurements on Livermore nuclear experiments. Later as the person responsible
for the overall Livermore Test Program, and since 1971 as the Chairman of the
DOE-NVO Containment Evaluation Panel, whose function is better explained later
in this book.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">I can say from my own
knowledge that the people, my friends, whose words are quoted in this book, are
all dedicated individuals who grappled with the dragon, and eventually caged
him, albeit uneasily, because they retained their sense of perspective, and of
the limitations of their knowledge, while doing so. I did not say "subdued
him", because they know, as I know, that whenever a nuclear explosion
occurs he is there, just as enormously strong, clever, and dangerous as ever.
Those who may be called upon someday to do an underground detonation should
remember that. The amount of energy released by a "small" one kiloton
nuclear device is simply beyond human experience and comprehension, except
possibly that of the unfortunate people in Japan who were near the second and
third nuclear detonations.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">It was the Department
of Energy Nevada Operations Office which supported this work, and to the people
there, particularly Richard Navarro, I give my grateful acknowledgement. Byron
Ristvet of the Department of Defense Nuclear Agency was principally responsible
for arranging the support required for the printing of the book. Without his
interest and the Defense Nuclear Agency's support, the publication of this work
might well not have happened.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">The people I talked
with were always cooperative in giving me their time for the interviews and for
editing the transcripts, and my thanks go to each of those quoted in the text.
Gary Higgins and Bob Brownlee were generous with their time in reviewing the
book and offered many valuable suggestions on various points.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">The table in Chapter
22 was compiled by Gregory Van der Vink of OTA. The pictures in the book were
provided by Roger Meade of Los Alamos, Steve Wofford of Livermore, and John
Weydert of Sandia. My appreciation also goes to the unknown Livermore artist
who, in the early seventies, captured the feeling of many people who were
grappling with containment problems.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Particular thanks are
due two people. Beverly Babcock assisted with many of the interviews and
transcriptions. She was also most helpful in such matters as arranging times
and places for the interviews, and gently encouraging the interviewees to finish
and return their edits. Aside from providing photographs for the illustrations,
Steve Wofford gave unfailing support on many questions of how best to arrange
the chapters and format the text. He deserves my thanks for helping in a very
substantial way on this project.</span><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-63"></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="msonormal"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">The science of the containment of the radioactive by-products of a nuclear detonation exists only because there was a period of from 1957 to 1992 when nuclear detonations were carried out underground by the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">The elements of several scientific and engineering fields are inextricably intertwined when people attempt to understand, calculate, and predict what will happen when a nuclear detonation occurs underground. The interactions which occur do so in regimes of material interactions, times, temperatures, and pressures that are never encountered in any other field.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">The earth, from the surface to the mile or so in depth that has been used in underground nuclear testing is an inhomogeneous body of materials. Such things as the density, the strength, the chemical composition, and the water content of the rocks vary in a three dimensional fashion over almost any dimensional element that is chosen, ranging from molecular size to kilometers. Given the volume over which significant effects take place, the expense of obtaining sufficient representative samples to test in the laboratory, and the fact that laboratory measurements cannot reproduce many of the regimes of interest, it is not possible to know all, or even most, of the details of the medium where the detonation takes place.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">So, empirical rules are developed, approximations are made and are used in computer codes to model the behavior of the earth materials following a detonation, but there is a further complication. Important processes occur during a time span that ranges from fractions of a microsecond to hours. Different measurement techniques and different calculational codes are required for different parts of this time span, and somehow must be linked together to try to understand the overall picture of what happens.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">In such a situation experience and empirical evidence from previous detonations assumes a considerable importance when trying to judge what will happen when a particular detonation takes place in some specific location. The experience and evidence that there is has been gathered over the years, sometimes in a costly fashion. Experience and its role in judgment is difficult to codify and make available to people who might be newly charged with the responsibility to detonate a device, obtain the necessary data from it, and simultaneously "successfully contain" the radioactive materials produced. Such a situation may never arise; if it does perhaps the words here may be helpful.</span></p>


<a name="ch1"></a>
<p class="msonormal"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Chapter 1: The Origins of Containment</h2>
<p class="msonormal"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">To discuss the
containment of nuclear explosions it would be helpful to have an understanding
of what "containment" is. Unfortunately, there is no simple
definition, or indeed, no uniform agreement as to what it is. Basically, it is
whatever someone in the appropriate position of authority says it is, as is the
case with many politically defined terms. And that also means that what it is
can change from time to time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">There are documents
which shed some light on this. The most important is the Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty, signed on August 5, 1963 by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and
the United States. This Treaty called for the signatory nations to conduct
nuclear detonations only underground, and in such a way that there would be no
nuclear debris beyond the boundaries of the State which conducted the
detonation. The operative article of the Treaty which relates to what would
become "containment," as it is currently known in the United States,
is Article I, Section 1. of the English version.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre12">Article I</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">1.
Each of the Parties to this Treaty undertakes to prohibit, to prevent, and not
to carry out any nuclear weapon test explosion, or any other nuclear explosion,
at any place under its jurisdiction or control:</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">(a) in
the atmosphere; beyond its limits, including outer space; or underwater,
including territorial waters or high seas; or</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">(b) in
any other environment if such explosion causes radioactive debris to be present
outside the territorial limits of the State under whose jurisdiction or control
such explosion is conducted.</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">This seems clear
enough, but there are some things that, on careful examination of subparagraph
(b), are open to interpretation. The first, and most important of these, are
the words "... causes radioactive debris to be present ..." What comprises
the radioactive debris of a nuclear explosion? Is it any radioactive product
produced by the explosion? Or is it only those radioactive products which will
ultimately be deposited on the ground, and thereby become "debris" - the
dictionary definition of which is: "The scattered remains of something
broken or destroyed; ruins?" This could be interpreted as meaning that if
you cannot go about the ground and find "scattered remains," or
fallout particles, you have not violated the Treaty. Hence, any release of
noble gases, which dilute in the atmosphere, which are biologically inert, and
which do not deposit on the ground, do not count. The answer to this question
of interpretation is of considerable importance to the people who are charged
with conducting a nuclear detonation, and at the same time with complying with
the terms of the Treaty.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">With one
interpretation, a seepage of gases from a detonation, however large, would not be
considered a violation, no matter where or how detected, because they would not
be considered "debris." Using the other interpretation, such a
seepage would be a violation, if large enough to be detected outside the State
boundaries.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Now consider the words
"... to be present outside the territorial limits of the State under whose
jurisdiction or control ..." In order for something to exist in this
context, somebody has to know it's there. If radioactive material did cross the
border of the State conducting the detonation, and someone, with some instrument,
did detect the activity, then the Treaty has been violated. If the material is
not detected outside the territorial limits, for whatever reason, it is
difficult, or impossible to claim that a violation has occurred. Another
document that can be considered as defining containment in the United States is
the Charter of the Containment Evaluation Panel. The relevant passages
concerning containment itself are Articles III, subparagraphs A and C, and
Article VIII subparagraph F. These are:</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">III A&nbsp;
Emplacement and firing of each nuclear device will be conducted in a manner
that conforms with United States obligations under all Nuclear Test Treaties.</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">III<b class="calibre15">
</b>C &nbsp;Each test will be designed to be successfully contained. Special cases
will be referred to DOE/Deputy Assistant Secretary for Military Application
(DASMA), for approval.</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">VIII F
&nbsp;Successful Containment: Containment such that a test results in no
radioactivity detectable off site as measured by normal monitoring equipment
and no unanticipated release of radioactivity on site within a 24 hour period
following execution. Detection of noble gases which appear on site at long
times after an event due to changing atmospheric conditions is not
unanticipated. Anticipated releases will be designed to conform to specific
guidance from DOE/DASMA (NV-176, Revision 5, Planning Directive for Underground
Nuclear Tests at the Nevada Test Site (U)).</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Note that the word
"debris" does not appear. For there to be successful containment, it
is "radioactivity" that is not to be detected offsite, and this term
certainly includes the noble gases. The boundaries of the Test Site are much
closer to the event than the borders of the United States, hence
"successful containment" is a much more rigorous standard than that
given by using either interpretation of "debris" in the Treaty.
Further, there should be "no unanticipated release of radioactivity on
site within a 24 hour period following execution." The implication is that
an unanticipated release of any amount of radioactivity within the 24 hour
period is a failure to achieve successful containment. The monitoring equipment
which might be used to detect such an unanticipated release is not specified.
unlike the case of detection off site where "normal monitoring
equipment," whatever that is, is to be used.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">What occurred between
1945 and 1963 that led to the Treaty, generally known as the Partial Test Ban
Treaty?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">It's
almost always true of any organization that there are outside influences that
make that organization change. It seldom comes from within.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - V. Leimbach</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">And so it was with
the Atomic Energy Commission, the Laboratories, and the field test
organizations.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Trinity, the first
nuclear detonation, was carried out on July 16, 1945, atop a 100 foot tower.
For the next many years that was one of the basic methods for doing experiments
with nuclear devices. There were variations, of course; the air drop and the
underwater detonations in Crossroads are examples. Sometimes the tower was
short, or non-existent, and the device was detonated on the surface. Sometimes
a plane dropped the device to detonate in the air. Or sometimes a balloon, or
rocket, lifted the device to a desired altitude, there to be detonated.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">For the scientists seeking
information about the performance of some aspect of the device, there were
trade-offs. The turnaround between experiments could be markedly decreased by
using planes or balloons, but it was not possible to do experiments that
depended on accurately viewing some particular area of the device where
phenomena of interest were taking place. Towers allowed that, but it took a
long time to build the towers, and install the carefully collimated and aligned
pipes through which instruments viewed a particular area, and recorded the data
from there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">There were other
differences among the ways in which the experiments were done, and these
related to what happened to the radioactive material that was produced by the
detonation. It was these considerations which gradually shaped the way in which
experiments could be carried out, and eventually led to the firing of all
devices underground in such a way that no radioactivity entered the atmosphere.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Initially, the
approach to the radioactive products of the detonation was to disperse and
dilute them, hopefully to a degree that made them of little biological
consequence to people who might encounter them. It was an application of a
belief once commonly held, not only by those detonating nuclear devices but by
those running factories and other industrial sites which produced unpleasant
and possibly dangerous by-products of the materials they produced:</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">The
solution to pollution is dilution.</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">With this approach,
if you were dumping waste chemicals into a river, and the river became badly
fouled, what you needed was a bigger river, so there would be more dilution.
The concept of controlling by-products of an activity at the source came
slowly, and only as a result of public concerns.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">After the end of
World War II the United States conducted nuclear experiments at Bikini, and
later at Enewetak as well. There was the Crossroads operation at Bikini in
1946, and the Sandstone operation at Enewetak in 1948.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Crossroads consisted
of two 21 kiloton detonations; one air-burst on June 30, and an underwater
detonation on July 24, 1946. These were weapons effects tests, to investigate
effects of a nuclear detonation on ships and other military equipment. In
Sandstone there were three devices of various yields fired, all on towers, between
April 14 and May 14, 1948. There was a significant difference from the focus on
the effects of the Crossroads detonations - information about the performance
of the devices themselves was an integral part of the Sandstone operation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Crossroads and Sandstone
were basically ship-based with minimal support facilities on the atolls
themselves. By 1951, when the Greenhouse operation was held from April 7 to
June 24, 1951, permanent facilities had been built on Enewetak. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Bob Campbell became
one of the Los Alamos Test Directors, and although he did not participate in
either Crossroads or Sandstone, he later had extensive experience in both the
Pacific, and in Nevada, starting with Operation Ivy, in the Pacific, in 1952.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Campbell</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Enewetak was first
used in '48, for Sandstone, and the whole nine yards of that thing was done by
the Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army types. And there were a number of lessons
learned on that. The AEC made their imprint on Greenhouse. The operation itself
was in '51, but there was well over a year and a half buildup. They had a big
structures program, and all the housing, warehousing - essentially everything
out there that we used for Greenhouse - was built by the AEC. They did a much
better job than the Corps of Engineers, because they had the idea that they
were going to operate these things for ever and a day. It wasn't going to be
done in the style of a Task Force campaign.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">You can
go back and look at the testing. The reason for Trinity was obvious; to see if
the thing would work once. Then there were the Japanese things. Then there was
a big hue and cry by the Navy, and so there was Crossroads. That was a Navy
show; all this Lab did was provide the detonation service. And the Navy did
themselves proud with Crossroads.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">Then it
was the Army's turn with Sandstone, but by that time the Lab had an interest in
it too, because they had some new designs to try. So, it was more or less a
joint venture. In fact, it was a little more than a joint venture. The Army
really acted as support to the Lab on Sandstone.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">The
Laboratory group who did those operations was formed the same way as it had
been in the past. You take somebody from this division, somebody from that
division, and somebody from over here, put together a campaign, and go do it.
Everybody comes back and then goes back to their regular jobs. At the end of
Sandstone, Darol Froman, who had been the senior Lab person there, realized
that wasn't going to cut it. It was going to go on and on, and so in '49, the
year after Sandstone, they formed J Division, a permanent testing division, in
the Laboratory.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">Froman
saw the need of it, and I've seen a fair amount of his correspondence on it. He
wrote some rather persuasive papers on why it would be better if they faced up
to it and said, "Here it is; we're going to be doing this for the rest of
our lives." And I think the AEC was right in listening to him, and going
along with a permanent plant at Enewetak atoll.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">Operations
in the Pacific, at what was called the Pacific Proving Ground (the PPG), were
expensive, time consuming, and required considerable military resources to
support the operation, the civilian construction workers who built the camps,
the bunkers, and the towers, and the scientific teams who came to install the
devices and the diagnostics. The construction started a year to a year and a
half before the actual tests began.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Gerry Johnson, after
a short time as a weapons designer, became responsible for the Livermore field
efforts, and then became one of the Livermore Test Directors.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Johnson</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Shooting in the
atmosphere required big task forces, and as a consequence we could not have
continuous operations. You had to mobilize, put things together, shoot them all
in an interval, then return to the Laboratories and try to figure out what
happened, rework the designs, and design new experiments.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">In
addition to that, the operations were complicated, unduly complicated, because
there were thousands of people in the field. They were spectacular shows,
people liked to see them, and so they dreamed up all sorts of reasons for being
there. That meant if you were trying to manage the operations, you had several
thousand people to try to keep track of. If anything went wrong, any confusion,
you had a hell of a time getting them out of there, and getting it straightened
out so you could do your work.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">After Sandstone there
were no more shots in the Pacific for almost three years, until the first event
of Greenhouse on April 7, 1951. In the meantime there was an exploration for a
possible location in the United States where low yield detonations could be
carried out, without the cost and time required for the Pacific tests. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">The Korean War led to
the declaration of a national emergency by President Truman on December 16,
1950. Two days after that declaration the President authorized the AEC to
establish a proving ground for nuclear tests on the Las Vegas-Tonopah Test
Range. Various locations had been looked at during the 1948-1949 period. Ultimately
a choice had to be made.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre12">: The Nevada Test
Site location was selected by Al Graves. He got on an airplane with somebody,
they flew around, and he found this nice area. You could put some boundaries
around it, there was a road to it on the south side, and it looked like it
would be easy to build roads.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">So, the
criteria used for the selection of the Test Site had nothing to do with whether
there would be atmospheric or underground shots. It was just a place we could
get our hands on. And it was a place that had a road to it, and a place where
you could land airplanes; it was an accessible place.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">And there
is another thing. When Al was selecting the Site, he was selecting a place
where Los Alamos could go to do interim kinds of things, and a place where we
could have our failures. We could have a failure there, because if it didn't
work we could come back here, and in a few days have another thing ready to
try. Once we got the various problems worked out, then we would go to the
Pacific to do the real experiment. That was the concept.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">So, the
Nevada Test Site was selected by Los Alamos as a place where you could do
certain experiments before you went to the Pacific to the permanent test site -
the Pacific Proving Ground. When we removed the people from Enewetak, in the
Marshall Islands, that was expected to be, at one point in time, permanent. We
didn't anticipate them going back.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">The
object of the NT5 was to do experiments close to home so you could go over to
the Pacific to do the real thing. So, you did the low yield here, and you'd
find out what wouldn't work. When you got ready to do one that really worked,
you went to the Pacific. That concept was believed, and held, and fostered by
people here at Los Alamos for, I would guess, four years. That was a long time
in those days. And then we realized that Nevada was good enough that we could
do a lot of things there that were not originally intended to be done there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">With the approval to
do continental testing, things moved rapidly. The Ranger operation consisted of
five airdrop detonations which were done in eleven days from January 27 to
February 6, 1951 at the (then) Nevada Proving Grounds. There were two devices
with a yield of 1 kiloton, two with yields of 8 kilotons, and one of 22
kilotons. All were detonated at 1000 feet or more altitude.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">There was also the
first of the things which would lead to today's world of "successful
containment." Fallout from one of the Ranger events left measurable amounts
of radiation in Rochester, New York, deposited during a snowstorm.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Of course, from 1951,
when the first tests were done at the Nevada Proving Grounds, until 1963, there
was no Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and from 1951 until 1961 there were no
requirements for any type of containment in the conduct of a test at the (now)
Nevada Test Site. If the concept of containment is considered in a broad
context, it relates fundamentally to a way to mitigate the effects of the
radioactivity produced during a nuclear explosion. These effects can be quite
close to the place of the detonation, they can take place at considerable
distances, they can be global in extent.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Such effects began to
be a problem soon after tests began in Nevada. By 1953, in the operation called
Upshot-Knothole, airdrops were used less and less, and devices with yields up
to 32 kt (Harry), and 43 kt (Simon) were fired on towers. Both of those events
caused off site fallout problems. In the case of Simon, some off site cars were
contaminated, and had to be washed down. In the case of Harry, the people of
St. George, Utah were told to stay indoors from nine until noon, to reduce
exposures from the fallout on the community, and the passage of the radioactive
cloud. There was fallout in Troy, New York, deposited in rain which fell. There
were reports (and later lawsuits) that hundreds of sheep in the Nancy and Harry
fallout patterns had died, presumably due to exposure to the radioactive
products of those events. The general public began to be aware of the actuality
of, and the hazards associated with, the radioactive material from the nuclear
tests at the NTS.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Worldwide attention
was drawn to the dangers of fallout when the 15 megaton Bravo event of
Operation Castle was fired on February 28, 1954. A Japanese fishing vessel, the
Lucky Dragon, was some 80 miles from the detonation, and was in the fallout
pattern. By the time it returned to Japan several members of the crew required
hospitalization for the effects of the exposures they had received, and one
died during treatment. Some 236 Marshallese and 3I weather service personnel
who were on downwind atolls, well removed from Enewetak and Bikini, were also
exposed, as were personnel on the ships of the Task Force.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Bill Ross was a
participant during Castle, responsible for the mechanical hardware that was to
be used for Livermore measurements on the Los Alamos Bravo event.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Ross</span></b><span class="calibre12">: I was on the
Curtis. We were issued the glasses the night before, told to wear long sleeved
shirts, and that sort of thing. We were about thirty-five miles away. You kind
of wondered, you know . There'd been the orderly room speculation about setting
the atmosphere on fire, splitting the world in half into two pieces, and all
that. And you began to wonder whether they really were seriously talking about
what actually might happen.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">Of
course, the shot point was below the horizon. There was this tremendous light
and heat, although you couldn't feel the heat at first. There was just the
tremendous light. Even with the very dark glasses you were squinting. And then
the heat came as the fireball got above the horizon, and it just g9t hotter,
and hotter, and hotter. We had been warned to hang on because of the shock
wave. By that time it was just so spectacular I'd forgotten all about that
warning, and I was just standing there. All of a sudden it looked like a gauze
curtain coming at you, smoothing out the little ripples of the water. There was
a bang, and from then on there was just a roar, a tremendous roaring that
seemed to go on for a long time. Finally the light got so dim that you were
opening your eyes wide and straining, and then you remembered, oh, I've got
these goggles on. When you took the goggles off it was still very bright. The
goggles were a darn sight darker than welding goggles. It was very impressive.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">We
started to get into the fallout, and the commanding officer of the Curtis got
out from under the fallout. But, the Navy didn't like their ships all going in
different directions, each commanding officer deciding which way to go, so they
were all told to regroup around the Estes, where the task force commander was,
which was right under the cloud, so they all went back into the fallout. We
just had a little bit of fallout and got out from under it, and they washed the
decks down. We were back out on the deck again when they got ordered to
regroup. We went back in, and here it comes down again. Then we were locked in,
and they were hosing down.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">My
stateroom was right near where the swabbies were going out on the deck and
cleaning up, and they had a monitoring station there. These guys would go out
in their raincoats and boots, and they would hose and sweep. When they came in
they would strip and pile the stuff on the floor, step over two feet, and a guy
would go over them with a counter. It was into the showers if you showed more
than 2 mR above background. All this time the pile of clothing background is
growing. At one point they were looking for the difference between 100 and 102
mR per hour. They were doing the monitoring in a 100 mR per hour field.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">I don't
remember how long we had to stay inside, but it was many, many hours. This
thing went off at five o'clock in the morning, and we didn't get fallout coming
down on us until after we had eaten, as I remember. We got a little bit, got
out from under it, cleaned up, and were out on the deck around nine or ten, and
then it was back in again. I don't remember when we got out. Herb Weidner and
some of the other guys who were over on the aircraft carrier Bairoko, they were
in a high field for days. The hanger deck was running, if I remember, a number
of hundred mR per hour for hours, and then they were down around 5 mR per hour
for days afterwards. They got a lot of exposure. In fact, the Bairoko never did
get cleaned up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">I didn't
see the fallout, but I was told by the guys who were sweeping it up and hosing
it off that it was like a white dust. It was calcined coral. An awful lot of
stuff went up, and it falls out, it definitely does. If you read the story of
the Lucky Dragon, they got caught in the same kind of mess.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">After Bravo, and the
Lucky Dragon, fallout was no longer just a local concern, or a U.S. concern.
Prime Minister Nehru, of India, on April 2, 1954 called for a testing
moratorium. Concerns in the United States led to the Atomic Energy Commission
finally to release some information about fallout. Before this there had only
been releases saying, in essence, that whatever exposure people had received
from the fallout from detonations at the Test Site were not large enough to
cause any problems. No mention was made of the levels of possible exposures, of
what radioactive isotopes were involved, or what areas were in the overall
fallout pattern. It was on February 12, 1955 that the Commission released a
report titled "A Report by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on the
Effects of High Yield Nuclear Explosions." This report did talk about both
the Bravo test and the fallout from Nevada tests, but did little, if anything
to reduce the concerns of the public; in fact, it may have exacerbated them.
Commissioner William Libby did make a public statement about the problems of
radiation exposure, and released scientific data about fallout in a talk he
gave in June of 1955 to the alumni of the University of Chicago, wherein he
made the statement that fallout did not "constitute any real hazard to the
immediate health" of members of the public.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">People working at the
Test Site were having their own problems with both local and offsite deposition
of radioactive material.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Campbell</span></b><span class="calibre12">: After the St.
George business, and after Bravo, it became obvious that we couldn't continue
to have that kind of off site fallout. If we wanted to get our job done, we were
going to have to find different ways of doing things. I don't think it was the
people in Washington. It was really an internal recognition that we had to do
something. And on site it was our people who were getting exposed making the
recoveries. Believe me, radiation readings in the fallout patterns were much
higher in Area 3 than they were in Utah, and we had to go in to get the data.
The rule then was that you could work people forever in 10 mr per hour fields.
In Nevada I don't believe I ever went into a field that was over 50 R. Fifty R
per hour is a lot, but you could get people who had not had much exposure, and
you could say, “The operation is almost over, you're going home, and this is
just for one time."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">Operationally
a number of things were tried, with the idea being to protect our own people.
In so doing there was, of course, a benefit off site. They tried making large
blacktop pads around tower bases, asphalt pads, to keep from entraining so much
dirt. You could keep down quite a bit of the dirt that came flying up
otherwise. And then there were areas where boron was put down, to reduce the
soil activation. That was in about '55, or even before.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">Towers we
bought by the foot; we'd buy pieces for several thousand feet of towers. Then
you take bits and pieces, like an erector set, and put up a two hundred foot,
or three hundred foot tower. We had towers that were triangular in cross
section, and towers that were square in cross section. The triangular things
twisted too easily in torsion, and wouldn't bear enough load either. There was
always the business of Herman Hoerlin wanting more lead, or Ernie Krause
wanting more of something else in the cab. We tried aluminum towers to get away
from the steel, but they didn't work worth a damn Do you want a little steel,
or do you want a lot of aluminum? It ended up that the aluminum just did not
have the strength and rigidity. It wasn't too popular, so we were always trying
to find ways to use the aluminum towers we had in stock.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">By 1956 people in the
testing community were beginning to consider seriously the possibilities of
conducting tests underground. This was a major shift in the thinking about the
problem of fallout. Previous efforts had been directed basically to dispersal
and dilution; firing underground would be an attempt to control at the source,
to keep the radioactive material in one place, and not to let it disperse.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Edward Teller and
Dave Griggs in 1956 wrote a brief paper (UCRL-1659) titled "Deep
Underground Test Shots." &nbsp;In it they concluded:</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

radiologic hazard is nil.</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">And, they recommended
that in connection with the next Nevada test series, (which would be Plumbbob,
in 1957) a low yield shot be detonated at the Test Site, "at such a depth
that it will be contained."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">At Los Alamos, Al
Graves, head of the test effort, had arrived at the same conclusion; the possibility
of doing tests underground had to .be explored, because nuclear tests were
going to have to be done underground if testing in the United States, at the
Nevada Test Site, was to continue. No such events had ever been conducted, and
the state of ignorance was vast. There were no equations of state for earth
materials, and no codes into which to put them if they had existed, and by
today's standards, primitive computers to run them on if the codes had existed.
No one knew how big a cavity would be formed, or what the post-shot cavity
conditions would be. No one knew what a safe burial depth was. No one knew what
the ground motion and seismic effects would be. And so on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">In 1956, Graves asked
Bob Brownlee to look into what might happen if a device were detonated
underground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre12">: One reason I
admired AI Graves was because he was so inordinately farsighted. He anticipated
problems long before other people. Where he came to have these ideas I have no
idea; whether they came from his colleagues, or whether they came from the sky
I don't know. He was the first one to my knowledge to ask questions of a
far-reaching kind about the hazards of testing. For example, "Is there any
chance that I will knock a piece of the shelf off the reef, which will then slide
down the edge of the atoll and start a big wave of some kind? What's the chance
of doing that?" As people talked it over, they decided that could actually
happen, and so we moved some shots. But those kinds of unanswerable questions
were frequently asked by Al first, at least to my knowledge.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">One
experience with testing in Nevada which must have influenced him mightily was
that in '55 there was a civil defense test where they sat out over two weeks
before the weather was right. They were very carefully watching where the
fallout would go, and if it was predicted to go over places where there were
people who couldn't be warned, and evacuated if need be, the shot was cancelled
for that day. That shot was scheduled every day, and then cancelled, for nineteen
days, and AI was the one making those decisions. Now, there were a lot of civil
defense people, and press people, and others, whose hotel reservations were
running out and so on, and they were very impatient with all this. And Al was
taking that pressure.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">He said
to me, in 1956, "There isn't any doubt about it. If testing is to proceed,
we're going to have to go underground. It's got to be done, whether we want to
or not. Would you start working on what it might be like to have a fireball
underground?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">I was
tied up for the '56 tests in the Pacific, but once they were over AI said
again, "Please go to work on underground things. It's inevitable. We're
going to have to do that, and the question is, 'Can you contain anything at
all? If you put the device underground, does it just all blowout, or what?'” It
was a very interesting question, and I began doing some machine calculations.
We were doing work on the IBM 704's, which were quite new then.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre12">: You were using, by
today's standards, a rather small machine. You were using a computer that had
less capability than the one you probably have at home now.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Oh, you can now
carry around, in your shirt pocket, something with more memory than the 704's
had. We coded everything in machine language in order to save memory. And we
had bits in the words which we used as flags, because you never did any
multiplication or division until the end, because that was so slow. The
programs were incredibly sophisticated in adapting anything in the world to a little
bit of memory, and to the machine's characteristics. You spent all of your time
doing that rather than working on the problem. I had this big deck of cards
that I would feed into the machine, and if there was a card upside down it was
rejected. It was a very slow, laborious process, but that's what we had in '57.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">The
earliest work I did was try to calculate the creation of a cavity. I had the
equations of state of four materials; aluminum, uranium, air, and water. I
said, “That’s the old Greek concept of earth, air, fire, and water. Earth was
aluminum, fire was uranium, and there was air, and water. With those four
equations of state I started trying to calculate what might happen underground.
Now, very quickly we began to get more refined equations of state, but from
those four I tried to make an equation of state for some fake material. I tried
to guess in what direction earth might be different from aluminum, and started
to change the various parameters. I finally evolved what I called the equation of
state of NT5 dirt.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">I look
back on it all now in amazement. How could anybody pay me to do such absolutely
worthless calculations? And yet, the fact is, they weren't all that bad. I
created, in my initial calculations, an elliptical cavity; I didn't really get
a round cavity. That was because of the inadequacies of my equations of state.
Of course, I didn't know enough to know what the answer should be, so, just
like every other theoretician, I fudged the numbers to make them kind of match
what I saw. By modern day standards it was an abomination, but for the time it
wasn't all that bad, and we were educating ourselves.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">Incidentally,
I feel very strongly about that. Machine calculations you should use to teach
you how to think. You don't pay any attention to the numbers, but they teach
you how to think, and how to see what is more important than something else.
And that's exactly what I was doing. I was getting a very good education. I
wasn't contributing anything profound to the system, but I sure was getting a
education about how to think about things. That's the real value of that kind
of work.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">So, I did
my first primitive calculations in '56. And I actually calculated one test,
Bernalillo, which we did in '58. That's how I got into the underground business,
and that was strictly due to AI Graves, who recognized the necessity to go
underground. There are a lot of people who don't realize that we were doing the
initial work for underground tests as early as 1956. Now, remember, we didn't do
that until ‘63, totally.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">One theme that was
present in the early underground experiments was that there was a definite
self-interest for the Laboratories' test organizations in reducing the fallout
from the shots. There was a need and a desire to reduce the fallout off site,
and to respond to the mounting public concerns, but also there was the need to
reduce the local fallout in the vicinity of the shot itself for operational
reasons.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Campbell</span></b><span class="calibre12">: The first thing we
at LASL did in a hole was called Pascal-A. It was 500 feet deep, in a cased
hole. We put the bomb in the bottom of it, and we didn't stem it. So, we fired
it. Biggest damn Roman candle I ever saw! It was beautiful. Big blue glow in
the sky. I was up in the CP office, and that was fired from a little handset,
out at the B-J Y.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre12">: You mean somebody
sat out there, and as I've seen in Tom Mix movies, pushed the plunger to blow
up the dynamite and foil the Bad Guys?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Campbell</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Well, pretty close
to that, but not quite. He had a little hand firing set. The shot was in Area
3, down by 3-300. The firing point was the nearest timing station of any size
to Area 3, and so the shot was between the people out there and the CP.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">Bill Ogle
was out there, in that timing station. When he saw that come out of the ground
he knew he couldn't come south the way he came north, because he was going to
get into trouble. Bill was more excited that evening than I ever heard him
before or since. He was really excited about how they were going to get back.
They went way out east on roads that didn't exist, came back around into Yucca
Lake, and came in that way. You've heard people say, "His eyes bulged out
like a stomped-on toad"? That's what Ogle looked like when he came into
the J Division office that night. He was really excited, and talked a mile a
minute. They were damn lucky they didn't go right through that cloud.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Why didn't you stem
it?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Campbell</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Didn't need to. We
did have a lid on the hole. Nobody's seen that since. We never did find that.
On that lid was one of Johnny Malik's detectors, and we wanted a line of sight
to see if we could measure some of the reactions. There was a kind of plug in
the hole. It was a couple of hundred feet off the bottom, as I remember. All it
was, was a concrete cylinder with a hole through the center of it, so the
detector could look through. And it had an annulus, so it wouldn't bind
anywhere going down. It was suspended from the harness that was holding the
bomb. It was a collimator, not a plug that was supposed to stem the hole. We never
found that collimator either, and it was about five feet thick.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">We had a
half dozen of those holes drilled in an arc around station 3-300, our alpha
station. We were in the business of making the transition from towers that were
looked at from the station. All our scopes were in there, and we were trying to
get something where we could use the same recording gear without having to move
it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">But
anyhow, bad as it was, spectacular as it was, there was only about a tenth of
the radiation on the ground around there that there would have been if we had
done it on the surface. And we considered a factor of ten reduction to be
wonderful. We thought we had made a real gain. A factor of ten meant we could
get back, and get set up and fire again more quickly. We were very happy with
the results, and we did it all over again on Pascal-B. That one doesn't stick
in my mind like that first blue one. That was our initiation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">The
reduction in off-site fallout was an effect that was appreciated by the AEC,
and the people who worried about offsite safety. What we were worried about was
being put out of business if we had too many people pounding on the gates. And,
we wanted to reduce the local fallout, the contamination of the area that we
were using.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">Jumping
ahead to the moratorium, it turned out that we had a little money, and we
drilled holes against the day that we might come out of the moratorium. We
really thought that was the direction we were going to go.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Bob Brownlee, who had
been asked to look at the possibility of firing shots underground, helped to
design the Pascal experiments, and attempted to approach the problem in an
orderly fashion. That was sometimes difficult.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Our first
underground tests were done in '57. There was Pascal-A, and Pascal-B, and Pascal-C.
And there were several others in '58, during Hardtack II. AI asked the
following question, “If I take a 48 inch casing, and I put a bomb a couple of
hundred feet down, by how much will the fallout be reduced?" We discovered
it was a factor greater than ten. And that was just an open hole. So, he then
said, “We put some plugs in the hole, does that cut it even further? And if so,
how much?" So we did that. Then he said, “Let’s put a plug right down on
top of the bomb, and then let's put a plug half way down. Does that make any
difference?" And yes, it does a better job if you put the plug right on
top of the bomb. “Well, suppose we put in some dirt. Does that help?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">We
started exactly that way. We were still doing atmospheric shots, so the question
was a very simple one. “If you do this, or that, how much will you cut the
fallout?" And we determined that experimentally. The answer to the fallout
question was, “We’ll measure it and see." On the other hand, the
calculations I did calculated the time the shock would get to the top, what
kind of top you might put on the hole to hold things in, what would the
pressures be there, how big might the cavity get, how does it cool, and what
happens to all that pressure? Does it lift the ground? Those kinds of questions.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">Pascal-B
and Pascal-C had plugs, but Pascal-A did not, although it had a concrete
collimator in it for the detector at the surface. The guys had been working
trying to get it ready, and there had been a number of troubles. They finally
got it down hole, by my recollection, about ten o'clock or so at night. There
wasn't much time to go back into Mercury, go to bed, and get up the next
morning to shoot it, so somebody said, ”Why don't we just shoot it now, and
then go in?" And it was the world's finest Roman candle, because at night
it was all visible. Blue fire shot hundreds of feet in the air. Everybody was
down in the area, and they all jumped in their cars and drove like crazy, not
even counting who was there and who came out of the area. Today it would give
the Test Controller and his Panel total apoplexy - they would become totally
insensate.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">It wasn't
done quite as logically as I have indicated, but there was a thread of logic
from shot to shot. We saw what happened on one, and decided what to do next,
but in the meantime we would have another one. So, the chronology is not as
perfect as you'd like to think it was.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">One of
the things we were annoyed about in '57 and '58 - I remember being annoyed, and
I say we because I think there were a number of us - was that we'd do an
underground shot, and the radioactivity from an atmospheric test would be
floating by at such high levels we'd never know what came out. The object of
the underground shot was to see how much we could reduce the fallout, but we
couldn't differentiate that fallout from the fallout of the atmospheric shot,
which was so much greater. So, I thought, "Why in thunder are we doing
this? The whole object is to find out what happened on this underground shot,
and after it's over we don't know whether it leaked or not, or how much. This
is absurd. Why don't those guys knock it off?" I remember having that kind
of an attitude, and I think there were several of us that were annoyed. But the
right hand usually doesn't know what the left hand is doing, and all that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">At the Livermore
Laboratory, stimulated by the Teller and Griggs report, work was being done to
fire a low yield device in a tunnel, with the object of completely containing
all the debris produced. Gerry Johnson was in charge of the Livermore testing
program, and was the Livermore Test Director.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Johnson</span></b><span class="calibre12">: It was becoming
increasingly difficult to carry out tests in Nevada because of the fallout
constraints, and the public furor over the fallout. There was a rising public
concern that kept growing through those years. In Nevada, from an operator's
point of view, we were only interested in getting the developmental
information. Actually, 1956 was when we began to think about underground shots,
and we were interested from an operational point of view. We felt if we could
go underground and get the data, then we could treat it as an extension of the
Laboratory. We'd go out and shoot whenever we were ready to shoot, without this
big Task Force and large numbers of people, because as you know, underground
shots are pretty dull to look at. And the duller the better.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Somebody said, “Watching
an underground shot is like watching a submarine race."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Johnson</span></b><span class="calibre12">: I've never heard
that, but you're right. That's a good way to put it. One of the big questions
we had was how to seal the tunnel, but out of a lot of stewing around the Rainier
experiment was finally designed, and we fired it in September of '57. And it
did contain.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">The Rainier event was
fired in B-tunnel on September 19, 1957. Even by today's definitions, Rainier
was successfully contained. The dragon was caged, and his foul breath no longer
polluted the air. Considering the lack of knowledge at that time about the
phenomenology of an underground detonation, that fact is somewhat remarkable.
After Rainier, perhaps containment even seemed easy. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">hubris:
n. Excessive pride, arrogance. From the Greek.</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Meanwhile, two
different paths were leading to changes in the way in which nuclear tests were
conducted. Since the Bravo fallout problems, opposition to continued testing
had been increasing in the United States, with wide publicity given to the
anti-testing or anti- bomb views of Linus Pauling, Albert Schweitzer, Paul
Jacobs, and others. There were anti-bomb demonstrations in England, West Germany,
and Japan. Politically, the issue of testing arose during the 1956 presidential
campaign, and influenced the steps that were being taken to negotiate a
disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. In August of 1958 President
Eisenhower announced that United States would suspend testing for a year once
test ban negotiations were begun on November 1, 1958, in Geneva.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">The Hardtack
operation had been conducted at the PPG from April to the middle of August in
1958. With the announcement of a moratorium to begin at the end of October,
Hardtack Phase II began some thirty days after the last shot in the Pacific.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">During Hardtack Phase
II Los Alamos conducted six safety shots in unstemmed holes, with yields
ranging from zero to a few tens of tons. These events in unstemmed holes were
not designed to be completely contained; the objective was still to reduce
contamination in the immediate vicinity of the ground zero, and to experiment
with various plug and stemming locations and configurations.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Livermore did seven tunnel
events during this period. There was one tunnel event which introduced those
people interested in containment to the possibility of an unexpectedly high
yield, or as some people might say, the unreliability of designers. Neptune was
fired on October 14, 1958, as a safety experiment with an expected yield of zero,
but with a possible yield of 10 tons or so. It was fired in a tunnel, with a
working point that was under the sloping face of the mesa, with a vertical
distance of 110 feet to the surface, and a slant range of 100 feet to the
closest point of the mesa. The yield of 116 tons was unexpected, the shot
vented, and produced a crater. The fact that some of the radioactivity was
released was not of real concern; Hardtack II was, after all, principally a
series of atmospheric shots, and the day before Neptune the Lea event, with a
1.4 kt device suspended from a balloon, had been fired. The Livermore people,
showing considerable flexibility in their thinking, promptly called Neptune a
nuclear cratering experiment, and in a future report, (UCRL-5766 The Neptune
Event; A Nuclear Cratering Experiment) discussed the "major contributions
of the data to the theory and prediction of cratering phenomenology."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre12">: In '58 Livermore
fired a shot, called Neptune, in a tunnel. It turned out that it gave somewhat
more yield than was expected, and it vented out the side of the mountain.
People have said to me, "That Gerry Johnson, he was probably the world's
foremost optimist. We don't know how he did it, but he could take a disaster
and convince everybody it was a great success. On Neptune he just didn't pay
any attention to the idea that the shot was supposed to be contained. He said,
'Well, that's our first nuclear cratering experiment.'"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Is that a true story?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Johnson</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Yes, that's
correct. I was told the maximum possible yield was ten tons. That was the
absolute tops. So we designed it for ten tons, and it went a hundred or so.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">It was a
lousy cratering experiment. It was on a sloping hill, but it was a point on the
curve. But you're right - you'll find that listed with the cratering shots in
the Plowshare program, and it had lots of analyses done on it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Gary Higgins, at
Livermore, was beginning to explore the possibility of collecting what were
called prompt radchem samples. The thought was that if some kind of pipe could
be designed that would be emplaced in such a way as to look directly at the
device, allow a flow of some very small fraction, but no more, of the device debris
to a collector on the surface, the expense and time delay of the post-shot
drilling for samples of the device debris could be avoided. Dick Heckman was
part of the group that was to field and collect the samples which might be
obtained.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Heckman</span></b><span class="calibre12">: We started off with
a few of the safety shots. The one incident that I remember in particular was
the Neptune event, in Hardtack Phase II. There was about a one-inch diameter
pipe which ran down into the roof of the room. The hole was drilled vertically,
preshot, and this one-inch pipe was inserted and grouted into place. We had a
plywood box built on top with a two foot by two foot aircraft-type filter
material with the appropriate screen, and with just a discharge on up. With the
yield that was anticipated, everything should really be kind of nice after the
shot.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">We then
backed off down to the Area 12 CP.&nbsp; I requisitioned a pair of binoculars, and
braced myself on my vehicle so I could spot in on the location. With binoculars
I could see the little sampling box, and since our success hadn't been all that
good on safety shots, I thought if something were to happen, maybe I could
follow the trajectory of the box so I'd know where to go and find it. The event
went off, and the yield was quite a bit higher than they expected. As a matter
of fact, that was one of the first cratering shots that the Plowshare program
takes credit for. The binoculars did no good, because the ground shock hit the
surface, raised a dust cloud, and I couldn't see a thing.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">I got a
bunch of radiochemists, and we went up and we saw the filter box was there, in
the crater. I argued like a Dutch uncle, and got permission, which in
retrospect was a dumb thing to do, but I got permission to get a rope tied
around myself, and to be let down into the crater. We were pretty motivated in
those days.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">So I
crawled down, and indeed found the filter box. I tore the filter paper out, but
the pipe had shut off and so we had no sample. Now, when I was given permission
to go down into this crater, it was, "Under no circumstances will you go
into a field which is greater than 1 R per hour," because they expected
this big fallout.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">Well,
going down there with my survey meter, I found out that the activity was
incredibly low - a few tens of mR per hour. In hindsight, as a result of
attempting to do that recovery, we got some very important information that really
excited some of the Plowshare people. When I came back and reported this, Vay
Shelton and Gerry Johnson happened to be down there at the time, and their eyes
lit up. It was sort of, "You've made the discovery, clearly you would want
to publish the paper.” At this point, the sampling system didn't work, so as
far as I was concerned there were other things to worry about. But it was my
crew in that recovery who were the first ones to discover that it was possible
to do a cratering shot and trap the gross radioactivity down in the ground.
Remember that all the previous experience had been with military cratering
shots, which were underburied.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Two of the tunnel
events in the Hardtack II operation were designed to give appreciable yield,
Logan, fired two days after Neptune, produced about five kilotons, and was
successfully contained. Blanca, fired on October 30, 1958 produced 22 kilotons,
and like Neptune, but in a more spectacular fashion, vented out the face of the
mesa.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">The Logan event was
interesting for several reasons. It was an event in a tunnel, designed to
investigate the effects of the nuclear radiation on various materials. There
was a horizontal vacuum line-of-sight pipe which extended for 150 feet from the
device, opening to two feet in diameter at the far end. From there two six-inch
diameter pipes extended another 75 feet. The design team started with some
money, with very little Laboratory manpower support available due to the heavy
shot schedule already planned, support from some contractors, a pad of blank
paper, a tunnel that was still being dug, and six weeks to design the
experiments and the diagnostics, fabricate the hardware, and have everything
installed for the shot. That is an incredibly short time scale by today's
standards. And, Logan was successfully contained. Arnold Clark was the project
physicist for Logan.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Clark</span></b><span class="calibre12">: We had six weeks,
because we had to shoot two weeks before, the end of October. We were going to
shoot in a tunnel, which hadn't been finished being dug yet, where an important
shot, Blanca, was going to be shot in another part. So, they had to have two more
weeks after we shot to finish off the cabling for Blanca. They would finish
digging out a side drift place for us, and they'd pull cable for us. Our
biggest problem was that we wanted a vacuum pipe in the tunnel; Here we were,
starting with a blank piece of paper, and we had five weeks to have that pipe
finished, installed, and pumped down.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">They
said, "How long do you want it?" We looked at our blank piece of
paper, and said, II A hundred and fifty feet." "How big around?"
"Oh, about this big," making a circle with our arms. And that was the
process we went through to specify it. So, we had a 150 foot vacuum pipe,
maximum diameter of two feet, made by NRL in Washington. It was flown out,
installed, and evacuated. And it held a vacuum! In five weeks!</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">Lockheed
made a very fancy, very strong steel sample holder to put at the 150 foot
station. Then people had second thoughts about that station, and said, "That
is not going to survive. Or maybe it's not going to survive." They didn't
know. "Maybe we better go out farther." So, we extended the pipe by
adding two pipes, 6 inches in diameter, to the back end of the big one, to go
out another 75 feet. And that's all that survived; the 225 foot stuff. We never
saw any of that 150 foot station after the shot. That was where the container
of very special steel, made by Lockheed, had been. It was a huge thing, about
the size of a really good-sized safe, just essentially solid steel. And it was
a very special steel alloy that was supposed to survive. Well, it didn't. There
was very little from that station.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">We had a
quite elaborate closure on the front end. There was a very fine theoretical
physicist, Harold Hall, working for Montgomery Johnson in early '58. They were
worrying about this containment problem, and Harold came up with the idea of a
Box A type closure, as they call it now. This was a brand new idea. Harold Hall
did some calculations, and so did Montgomery Johnson, and they said, “Ah,
yes!" So a Box A type closure was used for the first time on Logan, and it
worked very well. I think the front end was a foot in diameter, which is pretty
big. Maybe it was ten inches.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">When they
were digging back after the shot they also drilled back at different areas
around the zero room, and found that the really highly radioactive area, I
guess you would call it the cavity today, was pear shaped. It wasn't circular.
Some activity had come down the tunnel, but not very far except for a few
cracks that went out as much as 150 feet. So, it did contain completely.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">However,
it knocked in the side of the drift where Blanca was supposed to be, and there
wasn’t time to clean out that drift, so instead of being shot underneath the
mesa where it was supposed to be, Blanca was shot beneath the very steep face
of the mesa, out where the overburden was maybe half of what it would have
been. I watched it, and I thought the side of the mountain was going to come
right towards me and hit me. I was only two miles away.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">The days of
unrestricted atmospheric testing at the Nevada Test Site came to an end on
October 31, 1958, at midnight. As midnight came and went, Livermore device,
ready to be fired, hung suspended from a balloon, and there it remained until
the balloon was brought down and the device removed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Duane Sewell, who
later became the Deputy Director of the Livermore Laboratory, was the
Scientific Adviser to the Operations Manager for Hardtack Phase II, and made
the recommendation not to fire.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Sewell</span></b><span class="calibre12">: We left one device
unfired, and I remember that night very well. I had about fifteen hundred
people who really were upset with me because I didn't tell the AEC to go ahead
and fire that device. I told them not to fire it, because it was obvious we
were going to have trouble, but not from fallout. The wind pattern was in a
direction that was not going to give us trouble, and that last shot was a
balloon shot, so there was not going to be a great deal of dirt picked up, and
local fallout from that. But the wind pattern was such that there was a
potential for a pressure impulse into Las Vegas that was strong enough to
possibly break plate glass windows. We obviously didn't want to hurt anybody,
and didn't want to break windows either.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">We were
testing with shots of a half ton of high explosive mounted on one of the hills
a short distance from the CP. We'd fired a number of those during the evening,
and it was a double bounce. The shock wave bounced down around Indian Springs,
then the next bounce was into Las Vegas, and it was rather sharply focused. We
had trouble getting enough high explosive; I was blowing up all the high
explosives on the site to make those measurements every half hour to forty-five
minutes. The scheduled deadline was midnight on October 31st, Halloween night. I
remember a lot of masks around the place.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">Dodd
Starbird was the Director of Military Applications at the time that operation
was going on. I got on the phone with him, and I said, "That's midnight
Washington time, not Greenwich time when we start the moratorium." We
agreed on that. That gave us an extra five or six hours. When it got to that
point I said, "No, it's really midnight here," and I got him to agree
to that. Then I tried to get him to agree to midnight within the United States,
which would mean Hawaii, but he wouldn't buy that. He wouldn't go that far, so Pacific
Standard Time was what we finally had to go on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">We fired
the last HE shot about eleven-thirty that night. I was in the microbarograph
room, and we had people out in the field with mobile measuring systems. The
people there called in and said, "My God, what did you fire that time?"
It really shook them. Apparently we had them just at the focus, and I thought,
"Boy, if a half a ton can be heard that far, I'm not going to fire."
The last thing we wanted was to have any sort of damage, or the potential of
harming people in Las Vegas. That's why I made the decision I did. I advised
Jim Reeves not to fire and he went along with it. That's why we left that thing
hanging on the balloon that night.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">Louis Wouters was one
of the Livermore scientists waiting for the shot to be fired.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">Wouters</span></b><span class="calibre12">: We ended up with
one shot, Adams, being The Last, the last of that particular series. It was
going to be shot on October 31st, but something didn't go the right way, and we
didn't fire the shot. If the politicians had any sense at all they would have
let us shoot it, because it turned out that two days later the Soviets went
ahead and fired one more shot anyway, after the beginning of the moratorium.
They weren't as picky about those things as we were.</span><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-67"></div>

<h2>Chapter 2: The Rainier Event</h2>
<p class="msonormal"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
first nuclear detonation that was designed to be completely contained was the
Rainier event, fired in B-tunnel in Rainier Mesa on September 19, 1957, during
the Plumbbob operation. It had a yield of 1.7 kilotons, and for the first time there
was a nuclear detonation that did not release radioactive material into the
atmosphere.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During
the test moratorium that started in 1958 there were extensive explorations of
the cavity region and the surrounding materials. It was from the information
obtained during these reentry operations that many of the early ideas of cavity
formation, growth, size, and so forth originated.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gerry
Johnson was, at that time, the Test Director for Livermore events, and was the
person who caused the Rainier detonation to take place.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Johnson</b>: The
operational constraints, which were increasing each year, were bugging us, and
we were looking for a way out. Then Teller and Griggs did some back of the
envelope calculations and said, "Look, it ought to be possible to shoot a
shot underground, and if you had a thousand feet of overburden, you probably could
shoot a few kilotons or so." I was interested in that, and I said, "Well,
we'll examine that. We'll get some people looking at it and thinking about it,
and see what comes out of it." Which we did. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span class="calibre10">That was in '57. The Teller and
Griggs suggestion was about a year previous. They wrote a memo on it,
describing the concept. Two of the big questions we had were whether you could
contain it, and would the radiochemistry be any good. As usual, we got into big
arguments with Los Alamos on all issues from technical to cost.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chemists here felt
they could do the chemistry. We had questions about the sampling. We didn't
know if we'd have a pool of molten rock, or what we would to get into. Before
the event we had lots of speculation on what would really happen. There were some
calculations made in terms of what you might expect in ground shock, and
surface motion, and so on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We choose the site based
on topography. We decided on a tunnel geometry because we thought that would be
the best way to do diagnostics. And that's how we finally ended up with Rainier
Mesa. We ended up in tuff, which was good stuff to dig in, but we didn't know
anything about it. We didn't know what tuff was when it was first mentioned to
us.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then we began to get
into public information trouble. A number of us were interacting with the
geophysical community, which we always had done, for all sorts of reasons. Dave
Griggs made the suggestion, "Look, if you are going to fire a shot like
this, for the first time we'll have a shot closely coupled to the ground. We'll
know the yield, we'll know the coordinates, and we ought to make this
information available to the geophysical world, so they can take advantage of
it. In fact, you ought to announce it ahead of time."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we went through
this, and were told to hold the time of firing to a tenth of a second at some
predetermined time, which we agreed to do. If for any reason we were delayed,
and couldn't meet that time, we agreed to wait twenty-four hours and try again.
And we published this. That was fine. It was very altruistic and lovely, and in
the right spirit of technical cooperation. But about a month or six weeks
before we were going to be ready, an international geophysical meeting took
place in Toronto, and by then this event was getting lots of interest on the
part of the seismic geophysical community. At this meeting some guy made some
statement about Livermore planning to fire an "earthquake maker," and
it hit the headlines, and of course got the Atomic Energy Commission's attention.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>:
"AEC TO FIRE EARTHQUAKE BOMB!!!" I can see the headlines.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Johnson</b>: That's
right. Well, that did it. Strauss, who was then Chairman of the AEC, called and
said, "What in the hell are you guys doing out there?" I said,
"Nothing."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I went in to talk
with the Atomic Energy Commission, and I said, "We've gone through all the
calculations of what the seismic effects might be. This is a very low yield
thing that we're trying to shoot; 1.7 kilotons." That seemed quite small
to us. "And we've done all these calculations." Strauss said,
"That's not good enough. I'll tell you what you've got to do before I'll
authorize this shot. You have to assure the Commission that the shot itself
will not cause an earthquake. Number two, that it will not trigger an
earthquake, and number three, if a natural earthquake occurs at the same time,
you have to prove you didn't do it."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we put together a
committee. We got Perry Byerly, somebody out of Cal Tech, I guess Dave Griggs
was on it, a fellow named Roland Beers whom none of us knew, and somebody from back
east. They met. And we told them what we were going to do, and the whole thing,
and Byerly's first remark was, "You shouldn't be so presumptuous. One
point seven kilotons? That will do nothing seismically." I said, "I'm
not arguing with you."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called up Strauss an
appropriate time later and I said, "We've gone through this thing. This
board of experts got together, now we want to come in and talk to you."
Strauss said, "Who's on that committee?" I told him, and he said,
"I don't want any West Coast people on it." This was a setback,
because the West Coast seismic mafia was most of it. It turned out that the
only guy who was acceptable to them to be at this presentation was this guy
Roland Beers, whom we didn't know.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beers came to the
meeting. He was a soft-spoken guy, and didn't seem to know what was going on. I
thought, "We've lost the shot." I muttered to my partners, "I don't
think we're going to win this one. I don't know this guy; he didn't say
anything when we were meeting, and I don't know who he is."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we go assemble with
the Commission and have the meeting. I go through my pitch, describing the
experiment and so on, what we were doing, and what the conclusion of this panel
was. Strauss then looked at Beers and said, "Beers, what do you think is
the largest explosion that you could safely fire in Nevada, underground?" I
thought, "Oh God, what's he going to say?" And he said, so quietly
Strauss could barely hear him across this enormous table, "About a
megaton." Strauss said, "What!" Beers said, "About a
megaton, sir." That was all he said, and Strauss said, "You fellows
get out of here. The Commission and I are going into an executive
session." Which they did, and they decided favorably. "Okay, but be
careful."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So off we go, and by
then the furor had gotten to the state of Nevada. The day before the test
somebody from the Governor's office came to the Test Site to serve an
injunction on the AEC to stop the shot. The Governor said, "We'll hold the
AEC directly responsible for any damage to public works in the state of
Nevada." He wasn't going to take any responsibility. Well, bless Jim
Reeves, who was the AEC Area Manager for the Site. The day the guy came out to
serve the summons, Jim had to make extensive surveys of the upper end of the
Test Site. He was unreachable.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Well,
he was just doing his job. He has to go see what's going on, once in a while.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Johnson</b>: Sure,
he's the Manager. And we were going to fire the next day.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a technical
advisory board, with respect to the containment. These were vulcanologists,
geophysicists, I don't know who all, but distinguished people. The night before
the shot we had a final review. Shall we go ahead, or is there something else we
should do? And the conclusion was everything is fine, go ahead.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We arrived at the CP
early in the morning; I forget what time we were to fire, but it was during
daylight so we'd get good photography. I was there, and one of the members of
the advisory group came up. We were about an hour away from firing. This was a
fellow named Fran Porzel, who was an expert in ground shock, and shock
measurements, and so on. He was from Battelle, in Chicago. He came up and said,
"Gerry, I'm nervous about that tunnel, about the containment. There are
only thirteen feet of sandbags in there." I said, "Oh yes, we all
know that." He said, "I'm not sure that's going to hold."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then he began to
pace back and forth. And he kept talking and walking beside me. He said,
"Can't you just hold the shot for a few days? We'll go back in and put
some more sandbags in." I said, "How many sandbags would you put in?
What would you do?" and so on. Well, he wasn't sure. I said, "Well,
Fran, I'll tell you. We've worked on this thing for a year. We've had the best
advice we could get, including last night. If we open that tunnel up to do anything,
we have to start over, repeat all our dry runs, and check everything out again.
We'd have to do everything. I don't know how long it would take us to get it
straightened out so we could get back to a shot day. And this is the end of the
operation. We're holding the operation to get this shot off, and it's an
experiment. We could easily lose the whole thing, administratively, and I don't
want to do that."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said, "You know
if that blows out, everybody here will say they knew it was going to happen,
and it will be your neck that will be out." I said, "Well, that's my
job. But there's just no way that I can see to postpone. We're committed now.
We have to go ahead." I said, "I appreciate your bringing it up.
There really isn't a choice. If we cancel it now we might not get another crack
at it." But he really put the heat on me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of course, as it
turned out, it worked perfectly, but that's just a bit of history, and he could
have turned out to be right. But we had done everything we knew to do. And God
knows what would have happened if we had shut down. I think if we hadn't fired
at that time we probably would not have gone to underground testing. I think
it's unlikely. The next year we entered into the nuclear test moratorium. We
wouldn't have had time to do a test, set it up, and do enough to learn any more
about it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we did fire it, and
it was well established by the end of the next year, as a technique. We were
lucky in hindsight, as it turns out. The seal was just a simple spiral. We only
had those thirteen feet of sandbags, and a steel door to stop gases, but the
stemming worked perfectly. We got overconfident later and had some problems,
but Rainier did work very well.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as it turned out, we
recovered the radiochemical samples. The rock had frozen right away because the
cavity collapsed, so we never did find molten rock. But we were concerned about
tapping into molten rock. The question was, "How can we test that
out?" Naturally we went to the vulcanologists, and they told us that no
one ever drilled into a molten zone. The way they got their samples was to wait
for the molten rock to come to the surface so they could scoop it out in a
bucket.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About that time there
was an eruption on Kilauea Iki in which a pool of lava some three hundred feet
deep was formed, and later a thin crust about a twenty feet or so thick formed.
So we sent some guys from the Lab to drill through the crust and collect
samples, which they did. They only had to drill through twenty feet of stuff, but
to get to a suitable location they had to walk out on this crusty lava flow for
several hundred feet. Don Rawson headed the group out there. They had a
contract driller and crew, but they were with them. That experience convinced
me that at Livermore you could get somebody to volunteer for anything .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Gary,
when did you first became involved in the containment business?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: It was
at the Laboratory, not at the Test Site, and it was almost coincident with the
firing of Rainier. Gerry Johnson, who was then the Division Leader of the test
organization, I think then called Test Division, was working with Bill Ogle and
Al Graves from Los Alamos, who were deeply involved in the conduct of the whole
Plumbbob operation. Gerry went to Chemistry Division, and what Gerry wanted was
someone to look into the question of how you would do a radiochemical yield
measurement on Rainier, or a test like Rainier. I was in the radiochemistry
group of the Chemistry Division, and in the heavy elements part of the group.
My responsibility was the separation of the plutonium and transplutonic elements
from the debris samples from the atmospheric shots.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I came into this
picture just about the month Rainier was fired. I didn't know a thing about
what the underground effects of a nuclear detonation would be, so I thought I
would go talk to some experts, who obviously would know. And so I began to talk
to experts at Los Alamos and at Livermore. It turned out that all of the
experts had not come to a consensus. There was a range of expectations. At one
extreme was the prediction, or guess, that Rainier would produce a bubble of
molten rock about a meter in radius, and that the debris would all be contained
in that lava.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: But
Gary, you can just look at the calories available and know that there will be
more molten rock than a few tons.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: You'd think
so. At the other extreme there was the expectation that there would be
something like a 100 meter void, and the debris would be contained in a thin
shell of glass lining that void. This was about the period of time when the
French science fiction writer, Camille Rougeron, who made his living selling
these Jules Vern type ideas to the popular press, published an article that said
if you detonated a nuclear explosion underground, in rock, you'd get a glass
bubble full of steam, and you could then power generators with that steam for a
very long time. That was before we'd ever done anything in the Plowshare
program.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Who were these experts you
talked to?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Gene Pelsor was the one in
Livermore that I particularly remember, because his prediction was, within the
uncertainty of the yield, correct about both the size of the void that would be
produced, and the approximate amount of shock-melted material. His arithmetic,
the details of how he arrived at the numbers were incorrect, but with self-canceling
errors there were enough wrong things that his conclusions ended up being
pretty close to right.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: If you have enough wrong things
some of them will make the answer too big, and some of them will have the
effect of making it too small, so you might come close to the right answer?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes. The guys who were really
far off were the ones who made one mistake and got everything else perfectly to
maybe four significant figures.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the people who
made an estimate was Stanley Ulam, at Los Alamos, who was a theoretical type
person. He made one very simple mistake, and I'm inferring this from what other
people said, he did not say this to me. His error was to neglect the
vaporization of rock, in that he went directly from a solid to a Fermi gas, and
back to a solid. That neglects the region of condensed molecular gases. Half
the energy of vaporization of rock is in the phase transitions from solid to
vapor. There's another half that takes the rock from vapor to ionized gas. So,
the first half is a very important step function in the pressure-volume
relationship, but it's easy to leave it out because nothing very important
physically is going on except the change of phase. That was the small estimate.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very largest
estimate came from Bill Libby, and his was not very different from Gene
Pelsor's. The reason it was larger was because he did not leave any strength in
the solid. Gene let the solid be an elastic solid forever; what Libby did was
pretend it was a liquid with a back pressure, but no strength. The way to say
that correctly is to say he used a Poisson's ratio of 0.5 instead of 0.3, as it
really is. Which is kind of a dumb thing, but that does make the cavity get bigger.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: He
would have been correct if Rainier had been fired in water.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: Yes. It
would have been precise in water until the rebound occurred. Rebound occurs in
water too, and it causes a recompression, so the bubble rings. It oscillates
with a period that is proportional to the depth, which is a kind of restoring
force.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: If the
energy from the device wasn't going to melt much rock, where did they think
that energy was going to go?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: Well,
you and I think it's self-evident that there would be a lot of melt. But,
naively, people thought that all of the energy would go out in the seismic
wave. If you fired a kiloton explosion you'd get a kiloton seismic wave. If the
earth were perfectly elastic, that's what would happen. But it's not perfectly
elastic, and that isn't what happens. It's rather fortunate that only something
like one part in ten to the fourth of the total energy ultimately gets into the
seismic wave as energy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span class="calibre10">Dave Griggs, who has passed away,
was active in the seismic community, and was the author of the first paper that
made an absolute calibration of the seismic magnitudes of earthquakes translated
into energy. It was based on the nuclear explosions carried out in the South
Pacific - I believe it was the 1954 series. If the conversion were not so
small, the convergence of the waves at the antipode of the explosion would have
been sufficient to cause an eruption, like a volcano.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was if all the
energy had gone into seismic energy. The people in the seismic community had
calculated that if all the energy went out around the world and came back into
the same place at the antipode, and none of it were lost, there would be
another explosion. It wouldn't be any bigger than the detonation, but if the energy
went out one hundred percent elastically, it would be as big as - or a little
smaller than - the original explosion. So all you would do then, if you wanted
to destroy a target, was to go to its exact seismic antipode, fire off the
appropriate energy device, and say, "Who, me?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: That
sort of thing sounds like the days of the high altitude tests, where the
thought was that you would detonate a device at some altitude here, and all the
ionized particles would going running down the magnetic field lines and cover
up the enemy's radar over there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: Right.
You got it. But the business of the earthquake, and the elastic world was a
real concern. They still compute the elastic equivalence of earthquake yields
as the absolute magnitude. If you take the elastically coupled value for a
magnitude six earthquake, it's way less than one kiloton. And so there was real
concern that one kiloton, if elastically coupled, would be like a magnitude
seven earthquake. A magnitude seven earthquake, it causes some damage. But the
real world is not elastic, which is of some annoyance to those who like to
calculate things, because it would be much simpler if it were.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time Rainier was
fired there was a group of consultants who were assembled, ad hoc at first, and
then that group was formalized more or less, to advise the AEC, or the Manager
of the Nevada Operations Office, about such matters as safety. Dave Griggs was
on that committee. He got in by being in the seismic community, and being an
Air Force consultant. He brought George Kennedy along because George had been a
student of George Morey's, and knew about the melting of rocks and so on .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: People certainly knew some
things about the response of the earth, because for years and years lots and
lots of people had set off thousands and thousands of explosive charges. All
kinds of sizes, and in all kinds of places, and they knew the earth didn't
respond that elastically. So what were these people in such an uproar about?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, precisely the same thing
that they were in such an uproar about on things like Three Mile Island. It was
the unknown feature. And the people involved in the Test Program at that time
really weren't in the same community as the people who had all of this
experience with high explosives. There were a few individuals who carried that
experience over. One was a guy named Roy Goranson, in the very early days at
the Laboratory, who had spent a lot of his life with high pressure steam, and
steam explosions, and equations of state of water and rocks.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span class="calibre10">Gerry Johnson had the experience
of working with artillery in the Navy, and he knew from his experience what the
detonation of a thousand pounds of TNT would do, and how it would scale. He had
HE experiments done prior to Rainier. They tried to produce containment, and
discovered one of the differences between TNT and nuclear, which is the
residual gas.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't contain high
explosives unless you can also contain lots of residual gas. For every pound of
high explosive, you produce a pound or so of residual gas. In a nuclear
explosion the rock vaporizes and does all of its mechanical work, then as soon
as it cools off it goes back to be some kind of rock again, and the gas
pressure is gone. So, the containment of the nuclear debris is a much simpler, although
more sophisticated, problem than the containment of a high explosive charge.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's really extremely
difficult to contain high explosives. People in oil fields and in mining are
painfully aware of that problem. For that reason they have criteria for safety
and for detonations that are very different from those for the safety and
containment of nuclear explosions. The difference is understood by a few
people, but most people who grow up in one community don't comprehend the problems
that people in the other community face.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People who have grown up
thinking nuclear containment cannot understand why the oil field people want
explosives with the highest possible specific energy with the lowest possible
residual gases - they're extremely fond of nitroglycerine, for example, which
is terribly hazardous to handle. So you say, “Why don't you use something like
ammonium nitrate? It's a lot safer.” And they say, “Yeah, but we can't get
enough in there to shatter the rock.” “But why do you want to shatter the rock?
That just makes little tiny particles, and they'll plug up. What you want are
fractures.” They say, “Yeah, but if we do that, it blows out the top of the
hole.” “Well, then why don't you stem it?” “Oh, you can't stem it.”</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They don't shoot stemmed
shots. They put the explosive down, detonate it, and let it blowout. They don't
try, because they have never been successful in containing the gases.
Therefore, they don't use some of the most valuable products of the explosion.
The high pressure gas would do them more benefit than the shockwave, but they
don't use it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, back to the rocks.
It was difficult to select which expert to believe, except I could reject there
would be no bubble. All of them shared one thing; there would be molten rock,
and I believed that. The first conclusion I came to was that it was reasonable
from all points of view to expect the debris to be in fused rock. And if the
molten rock cooled, there would be glass. If it stayed molten, then the
question would be how would you sample it., The obvious answer was, you would
need to drill into it. But, without measuring we had no idea how complete or
how good the samples would be, or how efficient or effective the sampling would
be .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had some fused rock
from the ground surface of a number of near-surface bursts, including Trinity,
so we could do the chemistry on fused rock. We had done all of those things
with samples picked up from the surface. But we had no idea what concentration
of debris to expect in the samples we hoped to get. We didn't know whether we
were going to need a gram or a kilogram. And that, of course, depended on how
much rock got melted per kiloton. We did do some sensible estimates, again
using Gene Pelsor's calculations primarily.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe Gene was asked
to attempt to fully contain the explosion. Not maybe for the reasons that we
want it contained now, but that was his objective. The stemming procedure on
Rainier had been designed as a rather elaborate spiral buttonhook. The philosophy,
expressed in different ways by different people, was that the radioactive
debris would be charging around the tunnel at velocity V, and by the time it
went around the spiral, the seismic shockwave would have come across and closed
off the tunnel, trapping the radioactive debris. The placement of the sandbag
plug, I believe, was to stop jets. The idea that the buttonhook would achieve
containment neglected a lot of things. It worked for all the wrong reasons, but
it worked, that one time at least, very well, and it established that
containment could happen. I believe that a lot of Gene's work was not
recognized as being as good as it was, considering how little anybody really
knew.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>:
Somebody wanted to try to contain the shot, and that was probably Gerry
Johnson.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: Yes. I
think it was Gerry, although Al Graves had made the statement, before this was
done, that we weren't going to be able to continue to carry out atmospheric
nuclear tests forever, and we really ought to find an alternative method. He
didn't say it should be underground, or in deep space, or how. There were actually
four ideas that were kicked around in '56 and '57.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Underground was one,
deep space was two, deep ocean was three. Under the ice cap, either in the
Antarctic or under the Greenland ice cap, was the fourth possible way of
carrying out tests without contaminating the environment in any gross way. We
might criticize the ice cap or the ocean ways as contaminating, but at that
time, in that period, that looked like complete containment.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, Rainier was fired.
The next thing then was to find someone who could drill into it. In the fifties
a lot of our drilling was done by contract drillers, and most of the early
drilling underground was by E. J. Longyear people, and people that they hired.
The Longyear people were having real difficulty, because the drillers had to be
cleared; you had to have a green badge to work with the radioactive debris in
those days. To find drillers that they could get a long enough history on to
get them a Q clearance was not easy. Drillers, by habit, or choice, or
circumstance, don't stay in one place for very many months at a time. They go
from crew to crew, and place to place, wherever the work is good and their fancy
takes them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diamond drillers, who
are a group that we found were experienced in the small drills we needed for
the underground rigs, were used to doing ore deposit definition for the mining
companies all over the world. So, most of the drillers we had were non-U.S. citizens,
which made it even harder to get clearances for them. We had a real problem
getting three men to handle each of the three shifts - actually it means four
shifts because we were going to go seven days a week.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding that number of
drillers who were Q-cleared was really very difficult. Add to that the gossip
that was going back and forth in the union halls, or in the beer halls maybe,
about the possibility of thousands of pounds per square inch of steam, and such
high radiation that they'd be sterilized forever. One fellow told me he was told
that the samples they would recover, if they ever did get to where they were
supposed to, were going to be so radioactive that the whole crew on that shift
was going to be killed. Well, it makes it real hard to get people to do that,
no matter how much you try to convince them, or talk about what to expect. And,
we weren't all that sure ourselves. We knew the business about the
radioactivity wasn't true, but beyond that we didn't really know what the conditions
would be when we got there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal8"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>:
What was your role on the reentry?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: People
didn't have administratively designated roles in those days. My role was sort
of keeping tabs of what was observed, and reporting it, and asking questions. I
talked to the drillers, and the geologists. We had a geologist by then, and the
Geological Survey was involved. And I did chemistry measurements. A lot of
those. I still did that part of it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our first attempts were
to go into the tunnel, establish an alcove, and drill horizontally. I found out
drills don't easily do that; they don't drill horizontally, because the drill
stem droops. So, there was the issue of, well, where is the drill?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we had penetrated
the radioactive zone in the tunnel we had started drilling from the surface,
but that was 860 feet up. For reasons I've never been able to understand, they
cored all the way from the surface instead of just drilling in, and then
switching to a core bit. The communication between ourselves and the
construction people in the field was not good. Perhaps we asked them to core from
the surface, not realizing that they could very easily switch from a spade bit
that would have drilled much faster and have gotten down to the ground zero
zone very early, to a core bit.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the hole from
the surface never intercepted any of the radioactive debris because it came out
in the chimney, and all the drilling fluid ran out of the hole. The drillers
maintained that they could not drill without fluid because the drill bits would
not survive if there was no fluid in the hole. In those days they didn't have
reverse circulation drilling. They only had forward circulation, which meant
that the fluid came out behind the bit. So, if there was nothing around the bit
to confine the drilling fluid, it was not cooling the bit; it was cooling the
rock wherever it ran to. We really had to learn the drilling business before we
could ask the right questions, and we didn't know them then.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also found out that
the progress in drilling in the tunnel was painfully slow. The drill would be
turning around and around for days on end, but it never got anywhere. I found
out the reason that it wasn't getting anywhere was that the drillers didn't
want it to. As I said, there were rumors, including the one that this cavity
might contain thousands of pounds per square inch of steam.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, Gary, the drillers felt
they were going to drill into a volcano, filled with radioactive steam and
molten rock. Would you want to drill into something like that, which would spew
all over you and kill you and all of the members of your drill crew?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Of course not. So, they would
turn the drill, but they'd never push. We had a huge cavern worn out of the
side of the alcove into the tuff, but it went in only a few feet. I think there
was a lot more gossip and misinformation than we in the Laboratory ever heard.
I do know that there were drillers who would make all kinds of excuses for not
going on that particular drilling crew.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flangas</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, there was always some
concern over the unknown, but for those of us who came out of the mining
business, we were used to some risk. Now, there is certainly a difference between
intelligent risk and recklessness, and some of us know the difference. Gary
Higgins became an integral part of that crew, and I personally had a great deal
of confidence in his judgment and his experience. He didn't try to butt into
the actual mechanics of what we were doing, but he was there to advise us on
the things we didn't know about. It was a very, very close relationship. We
trusted him, and his judgment was good.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: His
story is that it took a long time to drill back into the cavity, because the
drillers weren't very anxious to get there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Flangas</b>: There
may have been some of that - some of the miners were that way. Occasionally you
would run into somebody who would be a little bit spooked, but once it was
explained to me, and I had a fairly decent grasp of what to expect, and as long
as the leadership was confident in what they were doing, our people just followed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, finally, after a couple
of months of drilling, and I think it was close to a year after Rainier was
fired, because we didn't start immediately, the drillers penetrated,
unexpectedly, a radioactive zone. That got radioactive debris into the tunnel,
and we had to shut down because the rad-safe people said, "You've contaminated
everything here." It was great news to me, but sad news to the drillers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went down and tried to
find some of the debris, along with some of the people from the NTS-LLL
contingent. We finally sorted out a bunch of sand and stuff, and when we took
it all apart a grain at a time we could find some little black pieces of glass
that seemed to be more radioactive then the rest. It was radioactive enough to be
an annoyance, but not a big enough sample to do any kind of measurements on.
Maybe we could have, but we didn't try. But the key thing that had happened was
that we had penetrated into a radioactive zone, and there was no high pressure
steam in it. Now, it was hot - it was hot enough so if they shut off the
circulation water it would almost boil. The water that was coming out was too hot
to hold your hand in. But the drillers then had great confidence it wasn't
going to erupt, and so, within the next two weeks they finally hit a mass of
lava. It was black frothy rock, and they got cores of it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We found a piece of core
that was gray and gunky, but it had a radioactive peak in it. And I said,
"I wonder why that is?" So, I put a rubber glove on and squished it.
I found little glass beads that were pendant shaped. From the shape, and the
fact that it was now solid glass, we could infer that it had been hanging from
something at some time. We said, "If it was hanging from something, it
must have been in a void space. It was liquid, and it has the shape of a liquid
drop, so there couldn't have been anything against it."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so we began to
reconstruct that after the cavity had grown underground it had stood there for
a little while - at least long enough for these glass beads to solidify. By a
process of reconstruction we worked out about how long that had to have been.
We confirmed that by measuring the ratio of some of the gas-precursed radioisotopes
that were included in those glass pendants to </span><span class="calibre10">what </span><span class="calibre10">they
were in unfractionated radioactive debris. It worked out that it was something
between one and a half and four minutes that this glass had been pseudostable.
The whole thing stood there before the roof caved in.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also looked at the
amount of water that was dissolved in the glass. Roy Goranson had produced a
table, and published it back in the thirties, of the solubility of steam in
silica glass. If you quenched a glass in water at ten bars of pressure, what
percent of that glass would be water, and how much water would remain as vapor?
He had the whole table of solubility of water in silica glass, and we got the
pressure of the Rainier cavity as being about 45 bars. We observed that 45 bars
was not all that different from the overburden pressure, at that depth of
burst. If one hypothesizes that the steam expands until it's in equilibrium
with the external pressure, then all of the pieces balance. So, that became an
adopted hypothesis for containment; that the cavity size is such that the pressure
would equal the overburden pressure. It turns out that's probably not right,
exactly, but it was a good working hypothesis. We now say stress instead of
pressure, and it is probably even correct.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rainier cavity was
about fifty-five or fifty-six feet in radius. That was the size it would have
been if the material in the first meter or so, around the explosion, were
transformed into steam and other gases, and they expanded until the pressure
was somewhere near the overburden pressure. That was the concept of a balloon,
or bubble, blowing up inside a pile of blocks, with no rock strength involved, and
that was pretty much what the model was that was used for a lot of the early
evaluations of containment. It's wrong, and it's wrong in a lot of different
ways, but it was extremely useful.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a year or so after
Rainier the Hardtack II series started, and we sampled several other
underground shots - Logan, Blanca, Evans, Neptune. We did not explore, in any
detail, any of those shots. We simply drilled enough to get rad-chem samples.
We were still going into the tunnel and drilling horizontally.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: When
you were drilling horizontally, were you then getting your samples from the
bottom of the cavity, or from the sides?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: They
came from the bottom of the cavity. From what we discovered on Rainier we
designed the scaling law that says the radius of the cavity is 55 times W to
the 1/3 feet, with W, the yield, in kilotons. That was where we found the
puddle that gave us a good, big sample. So, the target we drilled for was based
on design yield and 55 times W to the 1/3 feet. We usually aimed a little above
that, with the idea that if we missed it on the high side, as the drill
progressed across the cavity it would go through the puddle on the far side.
And we would carefully log, and almost always saw two blips on the
radioactivity versus depth of penetration plot. And we then said, "That's
the cavity boundary." And on the far side we'd say, "Well, the drill
probably carried some radioactivity along with it, so the far side is probably
a little too far." So you subtract a little from that, and do things like
that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those measurements were
recorded, of course, and people began to say, "My, isn't this interesting
that these things scale together?" Then they said, "What is the yield
that you get from the cavity radius by using the 55 W to the 1/3 feet law
backwards?" It wasn't very good, but it was a number.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We went through Plumbbob
and Hardtack II without really understanding anything about containment. After
Hardtack there was the moratorium, and during that time we did the post-shot exploration
of Rainier, in great detail. That was to measure accurately the boundaries of
the chimney region and the cavity region, and all of the physical parameters of
the shot. We wanted to measure things like the temperature, integrate the
thermal energy, and locate where all of the energy was deposited permanently. We
balanced the total release, as we measured it from the rad-chem yield, to the
thermal energy to within about 92 percent or so. We inferred that the energy
that went into producing fractures, which we couldn't measure, was in addition
to that. The seismic energy then was some number that was very small, which from
measuring the seismic wave you could also say was true. So, in a sense, we
balanced the total energy of the shot to within the precision of the various
measurements. Which is a satisfying thing for scientists to do.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We began to understand,
in the course of those drillings, where the radioactive debris was distributed.
Not only the kind we wanted for the rad-chem samples, but also there were, in
these logs of radioactivity versus distance, blips that were clearly at larger
radii than the inferred cavity radius.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You did find cavity material at
some distance from the cavity boundary? Did that material go along bedding
planes, or did you think there were fractures in the rock itself?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, we didn't recognize
bedding planes then. We did recognize faults. And there was a huge fault not
far from the Rainier shot point. At the time that the tunnel was mined some
drift in the B tunnel complex - I believe it was 12B-02 &ndash; was terminated. It
was designed to go into the mountain a little further than it did, but it ran
into this fault that was so large that you could look down it. You could
literally bend over and look in, and here was this hole in the mountain that
went off in the distance and you couldn't see how far it went. It was a real
fault, not like the things we map these days; it was empty. What we did was
back up from this big open fault and mine the button hook, and they put the
muck from the ground zero room down into the fault. And it just disappeared
down there. We didn't have to haul it out to the portal of the tunnel. That was
a big fault.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason I bring the
fault up is that in the post-shot exploration that we did in such detail, we
found that the center of all of the energy, both the radioactive radius from
ground zero, and the thermal regime, was displaced by a couple of meters toward
the fault. It was clear that the presence of that fault influenced the growth
of the cavity, and there wasn't real symmetry. One would like to say everything
was symmetric about the detonation point, but it really wasn't.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also found that if
you looked in detail, this cavity that we were fond of drawing with a compass
as a nice sphere really had bumps and wiggles, and had cracks that went out.
Some of those cracks were filled with various and sundry bits of what had been molten
rock. We also found evidence of enough hot vapor having gone out into some of
the fractures to change the color of the rock on each side of the fracture. It
had boiled water out of the rock, but there was no melt there. So, we knew that
the simple picture of a glass lined sphere, like a Japanese fishing float, the
kind you see hung in the seafood restaurants, really wasn't what the inside of
the cavity looked like. It was really pretty bumpy and wiggly, and&nbsp; probably
very leaky.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we had the first
core holes we saw the blip on each side of where the cavity was, but when we
mined that out we found a jumble of slabs. They were mostly planar slabs of
melt-covered rocks, folded over each other. When the geologist identified where
these slabs had come from, it turned out they had come from a hundred or so
meters above the detonation point. Then we began to have a picture that there
was the growth of the cavity, then a pseudo-stable period when it sat there and
nothing happened except some leaking of the high pressure gases pushing out,
and then slabs and bits and pieces falling in, jumbling in helter-skelter, and
the steam being quenched by pieces that were fairly large. It was not a hail of
small pieces of sand, but pretty big pieces that were falling in, and the steam
probably migrated some distance upward. In fact we found evidence for some gas
radioactivities in the rubble three or four cavity radii above the detonation
point.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: This
picture you're giving of these slabs of material falling in doesn't fit very well
with the accepted picture of a collapse. “The geophones were quiet, and then it
collapsed, and the collapse progressed upward at whatever feet per second.”
It's not exactly a plug falling in, but it occurs very rapidly, and the picture
is that the layers of rock would still be basically intact, just displaced down
some distance. You don't describe anything like that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: No.
That's right. What we observed, and I would say in an almost differential
sense, was quite different from what we inferred from the readings on the
instruments. And I see still a discrepancy between the detailed reentry mining
observations from Rainier, and from the general picture we get from the
observations of cables breaking and from the surface. I think that discrepancy
still exists to a degree. And you identify it very specifically.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would put this point
up, and it's one that has disturbed me and continues to disturb me. We have
only investigated in great detail one event, and that's Rainier. We've never
investigated in great detail any other one event. In the first place it's quite
costly. It cost us about as much to do the kind of post-shot investigation that
we did on Rainier as it did to fire the shot in the first place. So, it like doubled
the cost.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I must say that in
recent years the line-of-sight pipe tunnel explorations have in some respects
exceeded the information that was learned from Rainier. But it is not so much
about the containment of the shot as about the containment of the pipe, and the
phenomena associated with the pipe closure. When I said we've never explored
another shot in such detail, I meant in all the containment aspects in general.
In other, detailed areas, I think DNA has exceeded Rainier by quite a bit.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, you had the moratorium
going for you, Gary. People didn't have anything else to do. We wanted to keep
the miners busy, we wanted to keep Gary Higgins busy, and so we let them go dig
around in the mountain.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Precisely. And keeping the
miners occupied was a very important thing. During the moratorium a number of
professional people decided to abandon the Test Program. That disturbed a lot
of people who felt an obligation to maintain the defense posture that we had
because of our nuclear weapons capability. And so they asked themselves,
"How far can this loss of personnel go before we lose the capability to
resume, should we decide to resume?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a number of
answers to the question, but among the answers that emerged was the fact that
there were other skills than physics and mathematics and chemistry that we
would be losing, and one of those was our mining capability and our drilling capability.
Both of those skills had evolved well beyond, and different from, the common
industrial practice. In other words, any miner wasn't adequate. Or any driller.
Witness the fact that we'd sat there and turned to the right with no forward
progress on that first Rainier hole for two months or so. It was a question of
having other kind of skills that were as important as the scientific skills.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, during the
moratorium, we spent a lot of effort trying to understand what had happened in
the Rainier cavity. The business of what goes on in a cavity went through a
history like that in a lot of technical fields. There was the first evaluation,
and a simple model was generated, or invented, or selected from among a lot of proposals.
That model fit a lot of observations, so we said, "Okay,&nbsp; we understand
this part of the explosion phenomenology. We won't devote much time to doing a
lot more investigations, because they are very difficult to do."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they are difficult
because the stress levels within the area where the cavity is formed run not
just to kilobars, but to megabars and above. So, the measurement techniques
must be very sophisticated. The region that's involved is small, and things are
diverging very rapidly in space, so any measurement instrument has to be kind of
tiny. And everything goes on in extremely short periods of time, so getting
signals that are meaningful out from that region is extremely difficult.
Getting a fast signal out means a big co-ax, and a big co-ax means a big void
or something like that in the very small region. That is kind of contradictory
to the idea of measuring what is happening in that region without disturbing
it. There are a lot of contradictory requirements, or conflicting requirements,
when you try to make such measurements.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: In your work on Rainier there
were probably several things you wanted to do. Certainly you wanted to do radiochemical
analyses to get the yield. What effort was devoted to trying to understand what
happened to the rock materials themselves under the high pressures and high
temperatures that had&nbsp; existed?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The primary charge we had was
to be able to do on underground shots the same measurements we'd been doing in atmospheric
testing. So, that was the primary purpose of our efforts. In order to fulfill
that primary objective we wanted to know something about the mechanics, and the
chemistry, of how the samples we were recovering had been created. The basic
purpose was still to diagnose the performance of the explosive, not to know how
to contain it. The containment concern really didn't come up until much later.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were extremely
curious about what had happened to the native material, and we did a lot of
different measurements. One of the first things we found on Rainier was a lot
of glass, which was the tuff that had been melted and then quenched. We did radiochemical
analyses for a lot of different chemical species to determine how much total
rock had been melted, and how well mixed that melted rock was with the device
components themselves. Those conditions influenced how the device components
would behave after the shot, and what they would be like when we went back and
found the samples. We pretty well knew, from all kinds of laboratory and
atmospheric test experience, what the immediate surroundings were going to be,
and what temperatures and pressures things were going to be heated to. It wasn't
like working in total darkness. We knew that the initial temperatures and
pressures were going to be so high that the material present would be disassociated
into electrons and nuclei, and that there really wouldn't be any material
properties, other than those of a so-called Fermi gas.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That doesn't last long.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It doesn't last even a
microsecond. Some reports on containment describe what's going on in the first
microsecond as if that's a very short time. That's a long, long time compared
to some of the things that go on. The Fermi gas very quickly, in the first tenth
of a microsecond, probably has begun to expand enough so a genuine shock has
developed. That shock is a really strong shock, well above a megabar. The rock
is vaporized by it, and even though the gas may not be fully ionized, it's
still partly ionized, at least once or twice, so the chemistry's still not
important.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere out about a
meter or two meters from one kiloton enough energy has been absorbed, and
there's been enough spherical divergence of the shock wave so the pressure
level has gone down to where the kind of rock that's there is important. In the
model, that first simple minded model, what we used to do was say, "Okay, the
first meter that surrounds the explosion is made out of iron." We had a
fairly good equation of state for iron, and we knew what pressures would be
developed if you shocked iron to ten megabars. So, we started all our
calculations, whether the detonation was in limestone, or oil shale, or Nevada
tuff, or alluvium, with iron out to the first meter. We put the whole energy of
the explosion into that. Of course, if you do that, for most of the explosives
we talk about that means the composition of the explosive itself doesn't really
make a lot of difference.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sphere of iron with a
one meter radius is like ten times pi tons, so you've got thirty or forty tons
of iron to mix with the device. You mix in a small number of pounds of whatever
and it doesn't make a lot of difference. So, that assumption was very useful
for generating the correct shock out in the rock where we could make decent
measurements and the coaxial cables didn't get banged so quick that we couldn't
get the signals out. They confirmed that what we'd done by putting in the meter
of iron was right. So, okay, what was in that first meter didn't make any difference.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of that model is
correct, except that after the material has been shocked, it does something.
It's left behind as very high pressure atoms and electrons, but it doesn't stay
that way. The electrons and atoms that have been disassociated by the shock,
and other things, are going to recombine, and they don't really care what form
they were in before they were disassociated. They go back to a form that is
consistent with their environment at the time they are being born. The
electrons don't care that they were in tuff to start with; they're very happy
going back and becoming methane, for instance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The little bubbles that
were frozen inside the glass on Rainier were micro samples of the cosmos in
which they were formed. You don't know in the stage of expansion when that
glass becomes solid and the bubbles were trapped, but you do know that whenever
it did get solid, it was a closed sample. So, the analysis of those glass samples
showed us a number of things.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We took the glass, broke
it into little chips, and examined them under the microscope to find which had
closed bubbles. We put those in a vacuum system, heated them, and when the
glass melted the bubbles burst, and then we analyzed what the bubbles
contained. It turned out that what was in them was mostly water vapor, which, I
would say, was not surprising.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You refer to the material you
recover from the cavity as "glass." Why do you call it that? It doesn't
look like glass.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: No, it doesn't look like what
we think of as glass, but in fact it is glass. We had established that early
through some work with consultants at the Laboratory, in several ways. One was
to take some of the initial material we had recovered from Rainier, and do physical
measurements on it; measure its density, its index of refraction, and so on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you look at it
through a low power microscope, it is just like window glass. The reason, when
we look at it in a gross sense, that it is all black is that it has a whole
range of size of tiny bubbles in it that absorb all the wave lengths of light.
Plus there are some inclusions of metals, and other things. If you look at it
in a thin section it doesn't look black any more. First, it looks sort of dark green.
As you get it thinner it begins to look yellow, and then when you get it down
very thin it's perfectly transparent. You can see through it, with the
individual bubbles in it visible. Those bubbles are remnants of the steam that
was in excess of that required for saturation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor George Morey
of the United States Geological Survey, who was then in his late seventies or
early eighties, was intrigued with the whole of the phenomenology of the
creation of lava. He had worked for many years as a geochemist, first in the Geologic
Survey, and then after his retirement, at the Carnegie Institute. Then, when
they forced him to retire, he went back as Emeritus Scientist for the USGS.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was very intrigued
with the geochemical processes that go on in ground water, and how hot water
around volcanos and fumaroles really transports earth from place to place at a
very large rate - a lot larger than we mortals, who are here for an instant in geologic
time, realize. If that water is flowing from there to here, it's also bringing
along huge quantities of rock. And pretty soon, as the water evaporates and
goes away, the rock will grow here, and it will grow in whatever form best fits
this environment. Professor Morey spent the last twenty years of his retirement
searching out and quantifying these effects.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, what was going on
in Rainier, and the underground explosions in general, was a rapid speeding up
all the processes he was interested in. So, he was intrigued by the kind of
glass we would form from an ash. Volcanic tuff was spewed out of the ground as ash.
But on Rainier it had recondensed, after the shot, as glass. Why did it come
out to be glass, and not go back to being ash? So he got involved in this study
of the glass.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of his students,
George Kennedy, from the UCLA Institute of Geophysics, also got involved. And
there was another fellow, named David Griggs, who had been involved in the test
program from before Hiroshima and Nagasaki He was the principal geoscientist
involved with the Air Force advisory panel. Professor Morey, George Kennedy,
and Dave Griggs were involved in not only determining that glass was produced
from the condensation of the molten rock, but also in measuring its index of
refraction, and the amount of water vapor that was dissolved in it. From that,
and the radius of the cavity, we deduced what the steam pressure must have been
to make that kind of glass.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To form glass you need
some silica sand. As long as the ratio of silica to the other common earth forming
oxides, such as aluminum and calcium and magnesium, is large, the melt when cooled
quickly from its liquid state, or quenched, will always form glass. The rate at
which that glass changes back to being crystal silica, and alumina, and
calcium, depends on how much silica there is. The more silica the longer it
will stay glass, but it will change. That process of changing from glass to
crystalline form is devitrification.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glass is a metastable
liquid, but it takes a long time to devitrify, and for silica glasses that time
is measured in hundreds of thousands of years. At the concentration of silica
in the tuffs at the Nevada Test Site, the glass would prefer to be crystalline
quartz plus feldspars, but the process takes around five hundred thousand to a million
years. Those tuffs, as we know from many lead isotope ratio studies, and the
fact that they're there as minerals and not as glass today, are like two,
three, four, up to tens of millions of years old. Even so, there are still
remnant glasses from the original volcanic outpouring. Not a lot, but there are
some.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A nuclear explosion
converts the rock close around it to glass, with minor, minor exceptions. And so
the generic term is that the “glass” is the initially molten material, from the
shot, that cooled very quickly. The amount of glass produced is like a kiloton
per kiloton of yield, and that's not too surprising. The energy in the nuclear
explosion is just about right so one kiloton of energy will make one kiloton of
molten rock. And that's what we find out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going back to what goes
on the cavity, the other thing we found in those little bubbles in the glass
was hydrogen, and oxygen, and a little bit of carbon monoxide, and a little bit
of carbon dioxide. There really isn't much carbon in the tuff; there wasn't in
the Rainier ground zero area. But, the timbers that held up the tunnel were wood,
and all the electronics had rubber and plastic insulation, and plastic foam as
a dielectric. If you added it all up, there was enough carbon in the environment
to explain the carbon dioxide in the bubbles.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, how did the carbon
get from plastic to carbon dioxide? Well, if you have this big sea of electrons
and atoms, the atom doesn't know whether it came from plastic or rock. A lot of
what's around is water, which is hydrogen and oxygen. So, the carbon has a high
probability of combining with either oxygen, or even more probably with
hydrogen, because there are two hydrogens for every oxygen, so hydrogen is the
major material around. So, when you put hydrogen with carbon, you get methane.
The carbons have some affinity for each other, so a lot of them go around as
two's. And when two's go together, then you get ethane. Sometimes there's an
oxygen, so that makes methyl alcohol, or methyl formaldehyde. A whole suite of
hydrocarbons gets formed, not because they were there as hydrocarbons to begin
with, but because it's probable that they're going to become that in this sea
of mostly oxygen and hydrogen with the occasional carbon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More frequently than
carbon there's a silicon, or an aluminum here and there, but not many. For
every four oxygens there's one aluminum, or iron, or silicon. So they go back
together, and then as they cool they continue to react with each other. One of
the things that Russ Duff has noted, and I think he is onto a very important
clue, is that what is happening in the cavity, even at long times, like months,
is that these gases are finding each other and reacting.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A not very probable
reaction, but an easy example, is where a methane finds a water molecule, a
steam molecule, and reacts with it. The oxygen from the water will go with the
carbon in the methane, and two hydrogens will get formed. This happens at only very,
very high temperatures; as the temperature cools, that reaction goes the other
way. Water and methane are the natural products, hydrogen and carbon monoxide
are the starting reactants. That particular reaction occurs at high
temperatures, but stops abruptly at like 1300 degrees centigrade.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you analyze a lot of
these products, you can look at the ratios of the chemical compounds and derive
a temperature where they must have been "frozen." They call it
"frozen equilibrium," because the rates of reaction are exponential.
There's an old rule of thumb which we chemists use, which is not quite
accurate, but it demonstrates the principle: for each ten degrees increase in
temperature, you double the rate of reaction. So, it doesn't take a very big
change in temperature to have a reaction proceed extremely rapidly, as in
seconds or milliseconds, or extremely slowly, as in hours or days. That change
can take place as the temperature changes a hundred degrees or so.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The simplest ratio that
gives a temperature is the carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide ratio at a given
pressure of oxygen and hydrogen. If you look at the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen
to water, that gives another method of calculating a temperature. If those two temperatures
disagree, then you have a phenomenon you have to explain. It turns out they
don't usually disagree, and they haven't in the tests where we have made
measurements. They all give a temperature which is consistent with the cavity
sample that we had frozen out in the bubbles on Rainier, which was about 900 to
a 1000 degrees centigrade. That also turns out to be about where the melting,
or softening point of the rock is. So, all of this holds together, sort of.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In retrospect it's what
we should have expected, but we still tend to treat the material that the
shockwave traverses near the explosion as if it were iron, or rock, or
aluminum, or plastic. We forget that the world, and the environment around the
explosion, if you average all the stuff together, is almost half water. Normal tuff,
they say, is fifteen percent water, twenty percent water. That's by weight. The
molecular weight of water is eighteen. The molecular weight of rock is like
sixty or seventy. So, if you take twenty percent of something with a molecular
weight of eighteen, and mix it with eighty percent of something with a
molecular weight of seventy, the result is that there are more molecules of
water than molecules of rock. And so, if something is going to react, the odds are
just about even that it is going to react with something from water, and
something from rock. So, anything that's going to happen is dominated by the
water.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing we found on
Rainier was some fragments of glass that were formed by having been blown down
a fracture, which then squished off. We found such a fracture, and again we
didn't recognize its importance. We had this model of a smooth, round cavity
with a glass lining; we ignored the fact that at two and a half cavity radii
was a fracture containing some glass.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We found this fracture,
and said, "Isn't that interesting? I wonder how that glass got down there.
Well, it must have been a fracture." And, everybody said, "Yes, it
must have been a fracture." But in all of the literature you don't find
mention of the glass-lined cavity having spikes radiating out from it,
containing products from the center. In the model we mentally smoothed the ball
off, and forgot that there were fractures from it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point was that in
those fractures were glass fragments that were frozen out while probably it was
still in contact with the cavity, and they had elemental iron, elemental
copper, elemental uranium in them. These metals are extremely reactive. With
this sea of oxygen atoms we should have said, "They shouldn't be
there." But they were there. Again, we ignored that. It was the exception
that should have said our general model was too gross. Chemically, a sea of
electrons is about the most reducing thing there can be. In fact, you couldn't
get the average chemist to comprehend what a mole&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of electrons, just
electrons, would do.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the clues were
there. When the cavity forms dynamically, this high stress shockwave goes out,
running way ahead of the material. And we know, for example, that shock
velocity is greater than particle velocity, almost no matter how high the
stress level of the shockwave is. So, as the shock goes out from the explosion center,
it runs ahead of the material, but the material that is behind it is moving at
still a pretty high velocity. The shockwave is irreversible; it leaves a
portion of its energy behind as heat, which causes this ionization-disassociation
that's going on. There are more electrons around than anything else, so
everything wants to be reduced to the elemental state, and then start
combining. </span><span class="calibre10">Most </span><span class="calibre10">of the atoms that are present are
oxygen, so most things end up as oxides. It may sound contradictory to say that
oxides are reduced, but carbon monoxide is the reduced form, relative to carbon
dioxide, and elemental carbon, or graphite, or diamond, is even more reduced.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the state of the
cavity is highly reducing, and so, for example, if there is copper around the
copper will stay pretty much as elemental copper. You don't see big globs of it
because it's all vapor, and when it condenses, it condenses a few atoms at a
time, dispersed throughout the glass. The black color of the glass is not due
to radiation, and it's not due to carbon; it's mostly due to elemental lead and
iron in the form of single, or a few, atoms. What we should have learned, and
should have known from the Rainier fractures is that there was a period of time
when the cavity was growing, the boundaries were open, fractures were going
out, and the volume being interacted with was considerably larger than that
which we found when we calculated the steam pressure, and calculated 50, or 55,
W to the l/3rd as the cavity radius.</span><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-69"></div>
