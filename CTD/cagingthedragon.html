<h2>Publisher's Note</h2>
<br>

<p class="tab">
On July 16, 1945 the first nuclear explosion, the Trinity test, took place in the Nevada desert. It was an
atmospheric detonation and was highly successful, releasing radiation into the air that
will forever be recorded in our planet's geological history. 
During the next seventeen years over 200 above ground tests were conducted by the United States,
in addition to over 200 above ground tests by the Soviet Union.
It became obvious that atmospheric testing was a health risk because of the
dangerous radioactive byproducts being detected around the world,
many thousands of miles away from the test sites. In 1963 the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty 
was signed by the United States, Soviet Union and United Kingdom
agreeing to limit testing to underground explosions and contain
any radioactive byproducts within the border of the country conducting the test. This
effectively meant that underground nuclear explosions could not leak into the atmosphere,
a very difficult requirement to meet.
</p>

<p class="tab">
This book is a history of the design and implementation
of the United States' underground nuclear test program told as a first person narrative by the people who
actually did the work. The successes and failures of these tests are still affecting us today.
As is often quoted, every breath of air you breathe includes a
molecule from Caesar’s last breath. Even more so, every breath you take includes radioactive
byproducts from the nuclear tests described here. The people in this book understood this and did everything
within their scientific, engineering and budgetary power to contain the radioactive byproducts.
</p>

<p class="tab">
I did not write this book or capture the narrative of
the people working on this project, I merely converted it to a modern electronic format for easy
reading, studying and sharing because I think it should be. It is an important part of the story of people
like you and me trying to control the most powerful force of nature we know of.
</p>

<p class="tab">
Since this book is an original work by the United States 
government, it is part of the public domain. The original book contained poor quality photographs that were 
not captured in this electronic edition. If it's possible to find a source of the photos with acceptable quality,
I'll update this on-line document.

<h2>Preface</h2>
<br>

<p class="tab">
Robert Brownlee, in a talk given at the Monterey Containment Symposium on August 26, 1981, said:
</p>

<br>
<p class="tab"><i>
It has been said that there is no such thing as history, only biography. Assuming this
to be true, a description of the evolution of containment would contain the story
of the people involved - their experiments, beliefs, motivations, successes,
failures, foibles, and idiosyncrasies. We might then be able to understand our
current faith and practice, and their origins, in a far better way.
</i></p>

<p class="tab"><i>
Even for the earliest moments of containment of under-ground nuclear tests, when the
number of individuals involved in the subject was very few, the complexity of
the subject, and the parallel and relatively independent pursuits of Los Alamos
and Livermore, make a retrieval of biographical knowledge quite impossible.
</i></p>
<br>

<p class="tab">
In that context, this
book is an attempt to approach that impossibility. It has been my pleasure to
have had the opportunity to talk with people I know who played a role in the
development of our current faith and practice. This book is really theirs, and
that is shown in the extensive quotations from people who have spent much of
their professional careers dealing with the truly difficult problems
encountered. This book does not deal with the formulae and the mathematics, the
charts and graphs that make up the structure of the scientific and engineering
practice of the containment of underground nuclear explosives. Those things can
be found in the documents and reports written by many of the individuals who
have worked in the field during the past thirty-five years or so.
</p>

<p class="tab">
Here there are only
the recollections, memories, opinions, and stories of some of those many
people. Recollections can be faulty, memories fade, opinions change, and
stories often become better in the telling, but taken as a whole they may
convey something of how we came to be where we are in the containment world.
</p>

<p class="tab">
One regret I have is
that the quoted printed word does not capture the emotional content of the
spoken word - the humor, satire, frustration, sincerity that I heard during
these talks that we had. All are muted in a quotation on the printed page. The
inflection of a single word can change the way a statement is to be taken, but
how to convey that? The only way I know to attempt it is to give some brief
background on each of the people, in their own words. That doesn't have to do
directly with containment, but it does have to do with perhaps putting the
statements of that person in a personal context.
</p>

<p class="tab">
As for the context of
myself, I went in 1952 from being a newly graduated graduate student who had
done his thesis work at the U. C. Radiation Laboratory, to work with Herb York
on what he initially described to me, somewhat vaguely, as a "small
project." I somehow got the impression that it would be in Berkeley, and
would deal with controlled fusion as a source of power, and indeed that was
what I started to do. A few months later I had moved to Livermore with my
family, and by then I was aware that the "small project" was a second
nuclear weapons design Laboratory. Nine years later the Lawrence Livermore
Radiation Laboratory had a staff of perhaps 5000 people, and I became involved
with nuclear test work.
</p>

<p class="tab">
Since that time in
1961 I have been associated with the test program of the United States in
various capacities. First as the Division Leader of L Division, the people at
Livermore responsible for the design and fielding of the diagnostic
measurements on Livermore nuclear experiments. Later as the person responsible
for the overall Livermore Test Program, and since 1971 as the Chairman of the
DOE-NVO Containment Evaluation Panel, whose function is better explained later
in this book.
</p>

<p class="tab">
I can say from my own
knowledge that the people, my friends, whose words are quoted in this book, are
all dedicated individuals who grappled with the dragon, and eventually caged
him, albeit uneasily, because they retained their sense of perspective, and of
the limitations of their knowledge, while doing so. I did not say "subdued
him", because they know, as I know, that whenever a nuclear explosion
occurs he is there, just as enormously strong, clever, and dangerous as ever.
Those who may be called upon someday to do an underground detonation should
remember that. The amount of energy released by a "small" one kiloton
nuclear device is simply beyond human experience and comprehension, except
possibly that of the unfortunate people in Japan who were near the second and
third nuclear detonations.
</p>

<p class="tab">
It was the Department
of Energy Nevada Operations Office which supported this work, and to the people
there, particularly Richard Navarro, I give my grateful acknowledgement. Byron
Ristvet of the Department of Defense Nuclear Agency was principally responsible
for arranging the support required for the printing of the book. Without his
interest and the Defense Nuclear Agency's support, the publication of this work
might well not have happened.
</p>

<p class="tab">
The people I talked
with were always cooperative in giving me their time for the interviews and for
editing the transcripts, and my thanks go to each of those quoted in the text.
Gary Higgins and Bob Brownlee were generous with their time in reviewing the
book and offered many valuable suggestions on various points.
</p>

<p class="tab">
The table in Chapter
22 was compiled by Gregory Van der Vink of OTA. The pictures in the book were
provided by Roger Meade of Los Alamos, Steve Wofford of Livermore, and John
Weydert of Sandia. My appreciation also goes to the unknown Livermore artist
who, in the early seventies, captured the feeling of many people who were
grappling with containment problems.
</p>

<p class="tab">
Particular thanks are
due two people. Beverly Babcock assisted with many of the interviews and
transcriptions. She was also most helpful in such matters as arranging times
and places for the interviews, and gently encouraging the interviewees to finish
and return their edits. Aside from providing photographs for the illustrations,
Steve Wofford gave unfailing support on many questions of how best to arrange
the chapters and format the text. He deserves my thanks for helping in a very
substantial way on this project.

<a name="intro"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br>

<p class="tab">
The science of the containment of the radioactive by-products of a nuclear detonation exists only 
because there was a period of from 1957 to 1992 when nuclear detonations were carried out underground 
by the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France.
</p>

<p class="tab">
The elements of several scientific and engineering fields are inextricably intertwined when people 
attempt to understand, calculate, and predict what will happen when a nuclear detonation occurs 
underground. The interactions which occur do so in regimes of material interactions, times, temperatures, 
and pressures that are never encountered in any other field.
</p>

<p class="tab">
The earth, from the surface to the mile or so in depth that has been used in underground nuclear 
testing is an inhomogeneous body of materials. Such things as the density, the strength, the chemical 
composition, and the water content of the rocks vary in a three dimensional fashion over almost 
any dimensional element that is chosen, ranging from molecular size to kilometers. Given the volume 
over which significant effects take place, the expense of obtaining sufficient representative samples 
to test in the laboratory, and the fact that laboratory measurements cannot reproduce many of the 
regimes of interest, it is not possible to know all, or even most, of the details of the medium where 
the detonation takes place.
</p>

<p class="tab">
So, empirical rules are developed, approximations are made and are used in computer codes to model 
the behavior of the earth materials following a detonation, but there is a further complication. 
Important processes occur during a time span that ranges from fractions of a microsecond to hours. 
Different measurement techniques and different calculational codes are required for different parts 
of this time span, and somehow must be linked together to try to understand the overall picture of 
what happens.
</p>

<p class="tab">
In such a situation experience and empirical evidence from previous detonations assumes a considerable 
importance when trying to judge what will happen when a particular detonation takes place in some 
specific location. The experience and evidence that there is has been gathered over the years, 
sometimes in a costly fashion. Experience and its role in judgment is difficult to codify and make 
available to people who might be newly charged with the responsibility to detonate a device, obtain 
the necessary data from it, and simultaneously "successfully contain" the radioactive materials produced. 
Such a situation may never arise; if it does perhaps the words here may be helpful.

<h2>Chapter 1: The Origins of Containment</h2>
<br>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To discuss the
containment of nuclear explosions it would be helpful to have an understanding
of what "containment" is. Unfortunately, there is no simple
definition, or indeed, no uniform agreement as to what it is. Basically, it is
whatever someone in the appropriate position of authority says it is, as is the
case with many politically defined terms. And that also means that what it is
can change from time to time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are documents
which shed some light on this. The most important is the Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty, signed on August 5, 1963 by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and
the United States. This Treaty called for the signatory nations to conduct
nuclear detonations only underground, and in such a way that there would be no
nuclear debris beyond the boundaries of the State which conducted the
detonation. The operative article of the Treaty which relates to what would
become "containment," as it is currently known in the United States,
is Article I, Section 1. of the English version.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Article I</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1. Each of the Parties to this Treaty undertakes to prohibit, to prevent, and not
to carry out any nuclear weapon test explosion, or any other nuclear explosion,
at any place under its jurisdiction or control:</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a) in the atmosphere; beyond its limits, including outer space; or underwater,
including territorial waters or high seas; or</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) in any other environment if such explosion causes radioactive debris to be present
outside the territorial limits of the State under whose jurisdiction or control
such explosion is conducted.</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This seems clear
enough, but there are some things that, on careful examination of subparagraph
(b), are open to interpretation. The first, and most important of these, are
the words "... causes radioactive debris to be present ..." What comprises
the radioactive debris of a nuclear explosion? Is it any radioactive product
produced by the explosion? Or is it only those radioactive products which will
ultimately be deposited on the ground, and thereby become "debris" - the
dictionary definition of which is: "The scattered remains of something
broken or destroyed; ruins?" This could be interpreted as meaning that if
you cannot go about the ground and find "scattered remains," or
fallout particles, you have not violated the Treaty. Hence, any release of
noble gases, which dilute in the atmosphere, which are biologically inert, and
which do not deposit on the ground, do not count. The answer to this question
of interpretation is of considerable importance to the people who are charged
with conducting a nuclear detonation, and at the same time with complying with
the terms of the Treaty.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With one
interpretation, a seepage of gases from a detonation, however large, would not be
considered a violation, no matter where or how detected, because they would not
be considered "debris." Using the other interpretation, such a
seepage would be a violation, if large enough to be detected outside the State
boundaries.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now consider the words
"... to be present outside the territorial limits of the State under whose
jurisdiction or control ..." In order for something to exist in this
context, somebody has to know it's there. If radioactive material did cross the
border of the State conducting the detonation, and someone, with some instrument,
did detect the activity, then the Treaty has been violated. If the material is
not detected outside the territorial limits, for whatever reason, it is
difficult, or impossible to claim that a violation has occurred. Another
document that can be considered as defining containment in the United States is
the Charter of the Containment Evaluation Panel. The relevant passages
concerning containment itself are Articles III, subparagraphs A and C, and
Article VIII subparagraph F. These are:</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
III A&nbsp;
Emplacement and firing of each nuclear device will be conducted in a manner
that conforms with United States obligations under all Nuclear Test Treaties.</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
III<b class="calibre15">
</b>C &nbsp;Each test will be designed to be successfully contained. Special cases
will be referred to DOE/Deputy Assistant Secretary for Military Application
(DASMA), for approval.</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
VIII F
&nbsp;Successful Containment: Containment such that a test results in no
radioactivity detectable off site as measured by normal monitoring equipment
and no unanticipated release of radioactivity on site within a 24 hour period
following execution. Detection of noble gases which appear on site at long
times after an event due to changing atmospheric conditions is not
unanticipated. Anticipated releases will be designed to conform to specific
guidance from DOE/DASMA (NV-176, Revision 5, Planning Directive for Underground
Nuclear Tests at the Nevada Test Site (U)).</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note that the word
"debris" does not appear. For there to be successful containment, it
is "radioactivity" that is not to be detected offsite, and this term
certainly includes the noble gases. The boundaries of the Test Site are much
closer to the event than the borders of the United States, hence
"successful containment" is a much more rigorous standard than that
given by using either interpretation of "debris" in the Treaty.
Further, there should be "no unanticipated release of radioactivity on
site within a 24 hour period following execution." The implication is that
an unanticipated release of any amount of radioactivity within the 24 hour
period is a failure to achieve successful containment. The monitoring equipment
which might be used to detect such an unanticipated release is not specified.
unlike the case of detection off site where "normal monitoring
equipment," whatever that is, is to be used.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What occurred between
1945 and 1963 that led to the Treaty, generally known as the Partial Test Ban
Treaty?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's almost always true of any organization that there are outside influences that
make that organization change. It seldom comes from within.
<br> - V. Leimbach</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And so it was with
the Atomic Energy Commission, the Laboratories, and the field test
organizations.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Trinity, the first
nuclear detonation, was carried out on July 16, 1945, atop a 100 foot tower.
For the next many years that was one of the basic methods for doing experiments
with nuclear devices. There were variations, of course; the air drop and the
underwater detonations in Crossroads are examples. Sometimes the tower was
short, or non-existent, and the device was detonated on the surface. Sometimes
a plane dropped the device to detonate in the air. Or sometimes a balloon, or
rocket, lifted the device to a desired altitude, there to be detonated.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the scientists seeking
information about the performance of some aspect of the device, there were
trade-offs. The turnaround between experiments could be markedly decreased by
using planes or balloons, but it was not possible to do experiments that
depended on accurately viewing some particular area of the device where
phenomena of interest were taking place. Towers allowed that, but it took a
long time to build the towers, and install the carefully collimated and aligned
pipes through which instruments viewed a particular area, and recorded the data
from there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There were other
differences among the ways in which the experiments were done, and these
related to what happened to the radioactive material that was produced by the
detonation. It was these considerations which gradually shaped the way in which
experiments could be carried out, and eventually led to the firing of all
devices underground in such a way that no radioactivity entered the atmosphere.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Initially, the
approach to the radioactive products of the detonation was to disperse and
dilute them, hopefully to a degree that made them of little biological
consequence to people who might encounter them. It was an application of a
belief once commonly held, not only by those detonating nuclear devices but by
those running factories and other industrial sites which produced unpleasant
and possibly dangerous by-products of the materials they produced:</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The solution to pollution is dilution.</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With this approach,
if you were dumping waste chemicals into a river, and the river became badly
fouled, what you needed was a bigger river, so there would be more dilution.
The concept of controlling by-products of an activity at the source came
slowly, and only as a result of public concerns.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After the end of
World War II the United States conducted nuclear experiments at Bikini, and
later at Enewetak as well. There was the Crossroads operation at Bikini in
1946, and the Sandstone operation at Enewetak in 1948.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Crossroads consisted
of two 21 kiloton detonations; one air-burst on June 30, and an underwater
detonation on July 24, 1946. These were weapons effects tests, to investigate
effects of a nuclear detonation on ships and other military equipment. In
Sandstone there were three devices of various yields fired, all on towers, between
April 14 and May 14, 1948. There was a significant difference from the focus on
the effects of the Crossroads detonations - information about the performance
of the devices themselves was an integral part of the Sandstone operation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Crossroads and Sandstone
were basically ship-based with minimal support facilities on the atolls
themselves. By 1951, when the Greenhouse operation was held from April 7 to
June 24, 1951, permanent facilities had been built on Enewetak. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bob Campbell became
one of the Los Alamos Test Directors, and although he did not participate in
either Crossroads or Sandstone, he later had extensive experience in both the
Pacific, and in Nevada, starting with Operation Ivy, in the Pacific, in 1952.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Campbell</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Enewetak was first
used in '48, for Sandstone, and the whole nine yards of that thing was done by
the Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army types. And there were a number of lessons
learned on that. The AEC made their imprint on Greenhouse. The operation itself
was in '51, but there was well over a year and a half buildup. They had a big
structures program, and all the housing, warehousing - essentially everything
out there that we used for Greenhouse - was built by the AEC. They did a much
better job than the Corps of Engineers, because they had the idea that they
were going to operate these things for ever and a day. It wasn't going to be
done in the style of a Task Force campaign.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can
go back and look at the testing. The reason for Trinity was obvious; to see if
the thing would work once. Then there were the Japanese things. Then there was
a big hue and cry by the Navy, and so there was Crossroads. That was a Navy
show; all this Lab did was provide the detonation service. And the Navy did
themselves proud with Crossroads.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then it
was the Army's turn with Sandstone, but by that time the Lab had an interest in
it too, because they had some new designs to try. So, it was more or less a
joint venture. In fact, it was a little more than a joint venture. The Army
really acted as support to the Lab on Sandstone.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The
Laboratory group who did those operations was formed the same way as it had
been in the past. You take somebody from this division, somebody from that
division, and somebody from over here, put together a campaign, and go do it.
Everybody comes back and then goes back to their regular jobs. At the end of
Sandstone, Darol Froman, who had been the senior Lab person there, realized
that wasn't going to cut it. It was going to go on and on, and so in '49, the
year after Sandstone, they formed J Division, a permanent testing division, in
the Laboratory.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Froman
saw the need of it, and I've seen a fair amount of his correspondence on it. He
wrote some rather persuasive papers on why it would be better if they faced up
to it and said, "Here it is; we're going to be doing this for the rest of
our lives." And I think the AEC was right in listening to him, and going
along with a permanent plant at Enewetak atoll.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Operations
in the Pacific, at what was called the Pacific Proving Ground (the PPG), were
expensive, time consuming, and required considerable military resources to
support the operation, the civilian construction workers who built the camps,
the bunkers, and the towers, and the scientific teams who came to install the
devices and the diagnostics. The construction started a year to a year and a
half before the actual tests began.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gerry Johnson, after
a short time as a weapons designer, became responsible for the Livermore field
efforts, and then became one of the Livermore Test Directors.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Johnson</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Shooting in the
atmosphere required big task forces, and as a consequence we could not have
continuous operations. You had to mobilize, put things together, shoot them all
in an interval, then return to the Laboratories and try to figure out what
happened, rework the designs, and design new experiments.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In
addition to that, the operations were complicated, unduly complicated, because
there were thousands of people in the field. They were spectacular shows,
people liked to see them, and so they dreamed up all sorts of reasons for being
there. That meant if you were trying to manage the operations, you had several
thousand people to try to keep track of. If anything went wrong, any confusion,
you had a hell of a time getting them out of there, and getting it straightened
out so you could do your work.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After Sandstone there
were no more shots in the Pacific for almost three years, until the first event
of Greenhouse on April 7, 1951. In the meantime there was an exploration for a
possible location in the United States where low yield detonations could be
carried out, without the cost and time required for the Pacific tests. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Korean War led to
the declaration of a national emergency by President Truman on December 16,
1950. Two days after that declaration the President authorized the AEC to
establish a proving ground for nuclear tests on the Las Vegas-Tonopah Test
Range. Various locations had been looked at during the 1948-1949 period. Ultimately
a choice had to be made.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre12">: The Nevada Test
Site location was selected by Al Graves. He got on an airplane with somebody,
they flew around, and he found this nice area. You could put some boundaries
around it, there was a road to it on the south side, and it looked like it
would be easy to build roads.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, the
criteria used for the selection of the Test Site had nothing to do with whether
there would be atmospheric or underground shots. It was just a place we could
get our hands on. And it was a place that had a road to it, and a place where
you could land airplanes; it was an accessible place.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And there
is another thing. When Al was selecting the Site, he was selecting a place
where Los Alamos could go to do interim kinds of things, and a place where we
could have our failures. We could have a failure there, because if it didn't
work we could come back here, and in a few days have another thing ready to
try. Once we got the various problems worked out, then we would go to the
Pacific to do the real experiment. That was the concept.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, the
Nevada Test Site was selected by Los Alamos as a place where you could do
certain experiments before you went to the Pacific to the permanent test site -
the Pacific Proving Ground. When we removed the people from Enewetak, in the
Marshall Islands, that was expected to be, at one point in time, permanent. We
didn't anticipate them going back.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The
object of the NT5 was to do experiments close to home so you could go over to
the Pacific to do the real thing. So, you did the low yield here, and you'd
find out what wouldn't work. When you got ready to do one that really worked,
you went to the Pacific. That concept was believed, and held, and fostered by
people here at Los Alamos for, I would guess, four years. That was a long time
in those days. And then we realized that Nevada was good enough that we could
do a lot of things there that were not originally intended to be done there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With the approval to
do continental testing, things moved rapidly. The Ranger operation consisted of
five airdrop detonations which were done in eleven days from January 27 to
February 6, 1951 at the (then) Nevada Proving Grounds. There were two devices
with a yield of 1 kiloton, two with yields of 8 kilotons, and one of 22
kilotons. All were detonated at 1000 feet or more altitude.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There was also the
first of the things which would lead to today's world of "successful
containment." Fallout from one of the Ranger events left measurable amounts
of radiation in Rochester, New York, deposited during a snowstorm.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of course, from 1951,
when the first tests were done at the Nevada Proving Grounds, until 1963, there
was no Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and from 1951 until 1961 there were no
requirements for any type of containment in the conduct of a test at the (now)
Nevada Test Site. If the concept of containment is considered in a broad
context, it relates fundamentally to a way to mitigate the effects of the
radioactivity produced during a nuclear explosion. These effects can be quite
close to the place of the detonation, they can take place at considerable
distances, they can be global in extent.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Such effects began to
be a problem soon after tests began in Nevada. By 1953, in the operation called
Upshot-Knothole, airdrops were used less and less, and devices with yields up
to 32 kt (Harry), and 43 kt (Simon) were fired on towers. Both of those events
caused off site fallout problems. In the case of Simon, some off site cars were
contaminated, and had to be washed down. In the case of Harry, the people of
St. George, Utah were told to stay indoors from nine until noon, to reduce
exposures from the fallout on the community, and the passage of the radioactive
cloud. There was fallout in Troy, New York, deposited in rain which fell. There
were reports (and later lawsuits) that hundreds of sheep in the Nancy and Harry
fallout patterns had died, presumably due to exposure to the radioactive
products of those events. The general public began to be aware of the actuality
of, and the hazards associated with, the radioactive material from the nuclear
tests at the NTS.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Worldwide attention
was drawn to the dangers of fallout when the 15 megaton Bravo event of
Operation Castle was fired on February 28, 1954. A Japanese fishing vessel, the
Lucky Dragon, was some 80 miles from the detonation, and was in the fallout
pattern. By the time it returned to Japan several members of the crew required
hospitalization for the effects of the exposures they had received, and one
died during treatment. Some 236 Marshallese and 3I weather service personnel
who were on downwind atolls, well removed from Enewetak and Bikini, were also
exposed, as were personnel on the ships of the Task Force.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bill Ross was a
participant during Castle, responsible for the mechanical hardware that was to
be used for Livermore measurements on the Los Alamos Bravo event.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ross</span></b><span class="calibre12">: I was on the
Curtis. We were issued the glasses the night before, told to wear long sleeved
shirts, and that sort of thing. We were about thirty-five miles away. You kind
of wondered, you know . There'd been the orderly room speculation about setting
the atmosphere on fire, splitting the world in half into two pieces, and all
that. And you began to wonder whether they really were seriously talking about
what actually might happen.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of
course, the shot point was below the horizon. There was this tremendous light
and heat, although you couldn't feel the heat at first. There was just the
tremendous light. Even with the very dark glasses you were squinting. And then
the heat came as the fireball got above the horizon, and it just g9t hotter,
and hotter, and hotter. We had been warned to hang on because of the shock
wave. By that time it was just so spectacular I'd forgotten all about that
warning, and I was just standing there. All of a sudden it looked like a gauze
curtain coming at you, smoothing out the little ripples of the water. There was
a bang, and from then on there was just a roar, a tremendous roaring that
seemed to go on for a long time. Finally the light got so dim that you were
opening your eyes wide and straining, and then you remembered, oh, I've got
these goggles on. When you took the goggles off it was still very bright. The
goggles were a darn sight darker than welding goggles. It was very impressive.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We
started to get into the fallout, and the commanding officer of the Curtis got
out from under the fallout. But, the Navy didn't like their ships all going in
different directions, each commanding officer deciding which way to go, so they
were all told to regroup around the Estes, where the task force commander was,
which was right under the cloud, so they all went back into the fallout. We
just had a little bit of fallout and got out from under it, and they washed the
decks down. We were back out on the deck again when they got ordered to
regroup. We went back in, and here it comes down again. Then we were locked in,
and they were hosing down.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My
stateroom was right near where the swabbies were going out on the deck and
cleaning up, and they had a monitoring station there. These guys would go out
in their raincoats and boots, and they would hose and sweep. When they came in
they would strip and pile the stuff on the floor, step over two feet, and a guy
would go over them with a counter. It was into the showers if you showed more
than 2 mR above background. All this time the pile of clothing background is
growing. At one point they were looking for the difference between 100 and 102
mR per hour. They were doing the monitoring in a 100 mR per hour field.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't
remember how long we had to stay inside, but it was many, many hours. This
thing went off at five o'clock in the morning, and we didn't get fallout coming
down on us until after we had eaten, as I remember. We got a little bit, got
out from under it, cleaned up, and were out on the deck around nine or ten, and
then it was back in again. I don't remember when we got out. Herb Weidner and
some of the other guys who were over on the aircraft carrier Bairoko, they were
in a high field for days. The hanger deck was running, if I remember, a number
of hundred mR per hour for hours, and then they were down around 5 mR per hour
for days afterwards. They got a lot of exposure. In fact, the Bairoko never did
get cleaned up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I didn't
see the fallout, but I was told by the guys who were sweeping it up and hosing
it off that it was like a white dust. It was calcined coral. An awful lot of
stuff went up, and it falls out, it definitely does. If you read the story of
the Lucky Dragon, they got caught in the same kind of mess.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After Bravo, and the
Lucky Dragon, fallout was no longer just a local concern, or a U.S. concern.
Prime Minister Nehru, of India, on April 2, 1954 called for a testing
moratorium. Concerns in the United States led to the Atomic Energy Commission
finally to release some information about fallout. Before this there had only
been releases saying, in essence, that whatever exposure people had received
from the fallout from detonations at the Test Site were not large enough to
cause any problems. No mention was made of the levels of possible exposures, of
what radioactive isotopes were involved, or what areas were in the overall
fallout pattern. It was on February 12, 1955 that the Commission released a
report titled "A Report by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on the
Effects of High Yield Nuclear Explosions." This report did talk about both
the Bravo test and the fallout from Nevada tests, but did little, if anything
to reduce the concerns of the public; in fact, it may have exacerbated them.
Commissioner William Libby did make a public statement about the problems of
radiation exposure, and released scientific data about fallout in a talk he
gave in June of 1955 to the alumni of the University of Chicago, wherein he
made the statement that fallout did not "constitute any real hazard to the
immediate health" of members of the public.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
People working at the
Test Site were having their own problems with both local and offsite deposition
of radioactive material.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Campbell</span></b><span class="calibre12">: After the St.
George business, and after Bravo, it became obvious that we couldn't continue
to have that kind of off site fallout. If we wanted to get our job done, we were
going to have to find different ways of doing things. I don't think it was the
people in Washington. It was really an internal recognition that we had to do
something. And on site it was our people who were getting exposed making the
recoveries. Believe me, radiation readings in the fallout patterns were much
higher in Area 3 than they were in Utah, and we had to go in to get the data.
The rule then was that you could work people forever in 10 mr per hour fields.
In Nevada I don't believe I ever went into a field that was over 50 R. Fifty R
per hour is a lot, but you could get people who had not had much exposure, and
you could say, “The operation is almost over, you're going home, and this is
just for one time."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Operationally
a number of things were tried, with the idea being to protect our own people.
In so doing there was, of course, a benefit off site. They tried making large
blacktop pads around tower bases, asphalt pads, to keep from entraining so much
dirt. You could keep down quite a bit of the dirt that came flying up
otherwise. And then there were areas where boron was put down, to reduce the
soil activation. That was in about '55, or even before.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Towers we
bought by the foot; we'd buy pieces for several thousand feet of towers. Then
you take bits and pieces, like an erector set, and put up a two hundred foot,
or three hundred foot tower. We had towers that were triangular in cross
section, and towers that were square in cross section. The triangular things
twisted too easily in torsion, and wouldn't bear enough load either. There was
always the business of Herman Hoerlin wanting more lead, or Ernie Krause
wanting more of something else in the cab. We tried aluminum towers to get away
from the steel, but they didn't work worth a damn Do you want a little steel,
or do you want a lot of aluminum? It ended up that the aluminum just did not
have the strength and rigidity. It wasn't too popular, so we were always trying
to find ways to use the aluminum towers we had in stock.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By 1956 people in the
testing community were beginning to consider seriously the possibilities of
conducting tests underground. This was a major shift in the thinking about the
problem of fallout. Previous efforts had been directed basically to dispersal
and dilution; firing underground would be an attempt to control at the source,
to keep the radioactive material in one place, and not to let it disperse.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Edward Teller and
Dave Griggs in 1956 wrote a brief paper (UCRL-1659) titled "Deep
Underground Test Shots." &nbsp;In it they concluded:</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And, they recommended
that in connection with the next Nevada test series, (which would be Plumbbob,
in 1957) a low yield shot be detonated at the Test Site, "at such a depth
that it will be contained."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At Los Alamos, Al
Graves, head of the test effort, had arrived at the same conclusion; the possibility
of doing tests underground had to .be explored, because nuclear tests were
going to have to be done underground if testing in the United States, at the
Nevada Test Site, was to continue. No such events had ever been conducted, and
the state of ignorance was vast. There were no equations of state for earth
materials, and no codes into which to put them if they had existed, and by
today's standards, primitive computers to run them on if the codes had existed.
No one knew how big a cavity would be formed, or what the post-shot cavity
conditions would be. No one knew what a safe burial depth was. No one knew what
the ground motion and seismic effects would be. And so on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1956, Graves asked
Bob Brownlee to look into what might happen if a device were detonated
underground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre12">: One reason I
admired AI Graves was because he was so inordinately farsighted. He anticipated
problems long before other people. Where he came to have these ideas I have no
idea; whether they came from his colleagues, or whether they came from the sky
I don't know. He was the first one to my knowledge to ask questions of a
far-reaching kind about the hazards of testing. For example, "Is there any
chance that I will knock a piece of the shelf off the reef, which will then slide
down the edge of the atoll and start a big wave of some kind? What's the chance
of doing that?" As people talked it over, they decided that could actually
happen, and so we moved some shots. But those kinds of unanswerable questions
were frequently asked by Al first, at least to my knowledge.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One
experience with testing in Nevada which must have influenced him mightily was
that in '55 there was a civil defense test where they sat out over two weeks
before the weather was right. They were very carefully watching where the
fallout would go, and if it was predicted to go over places where there were
people who couldn't be warned, and evacuated if need be, the shot was cancelled
for that day. That shot was scheduled every day, and then cancelled, for nineteen
days, and AI was the one making those decisions. Now, there were a lot of civil
defense people, and press people, and others, whose hotel reservations were
running out and so on, and they were very impatient with all this. And Al was
taking that pressure.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He said
to me, in 1956, "There isn't any doubt about it. If testing is to proceed,
we're going to have to go underground. It's got to be done, whether we want to
or not. Would you start working on what it might be like to have a fireball
underground?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was
tied up for the '56 tests in the Pacific, but once they were over AI said
again, "Please go to work on underground things. It's inevitable. We're
going to have to do that, and the question is, 'Can you contain anything at
all? If you put the device underground, does it just all blowout, or what?'” It
was a very interesting question, and I began doing some machine calculations.
We were doing work on the IBM 704's, which were quite new then.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre12">: You were using, by
today's standards, a rather small machine. You were using a computer that had
less capability than the one you probably have at home now.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Oh, you can now
carry around, in your shirt pocket, something with more memory than the 704's
had. We coded everything in machine language in order to save memory. And we
had bits in the words which we used as flags, because you never did any
multiplication or division until the end, because that was so slow. The
programs were incredibly sophisticated in adapting anything in the world to a little
bit of memory, and to the machine's characteristics. You spent all of your time
doing that rather than working on the problem. I had this big deck of cards
that I would feed into the machine, and if there was a card upside down it was
rejected. It was a very slow, laborious process, but that's what we had in '57.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The
earliest work I did was try to calculate the creation of a cavity. I had the
equations of state of four materials; aluminum, uranium, air, and water. I
said, “That’s the old Greek concept of earth, air, fire, and water. Earth was
aluminum, fire was uranium, and there was air, and water. With those four
equations of state I started trying to calculate what might happen underground.
Now, very quickly we began to get more refined equations of state, but from
those four I tried to make an equation of state for some fake material. I tried
to guess in what direction earth might be different from aluminum, and started
to change the various parameters. I finally evolved what I called the equation of
state of NT5 dirt.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I look
back on it all now in amazement. How could anybody pay me to do such absolutely
worthless calculations? And yet, the fact is, they weren't all that bad. I
created, in my initial calculations, an elliptical cavity; I didn't really get
a round cavity. That was because of the inadequacies of my equations of state.
Of course, I didn't know enough to know what the answer should be, so, just
like every other theoretician, I fudged the numbers to make them kind of match
what I saw. By modern day standards it was an abomination, but for the time it
wasn't all that bad, and we were educating ourselves.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Incidentally,
I feel very strongly about that. Machine calculations you should use to teach
you how to think. You don't pay any attention to the numbers, but they teach
you how to think, and how to see what is more important than something else.
And that's exactly what I was doing. I was getting a very good education. I
wasn't contributing anything profound to the system, but I sure was getting a
education about how to think about things. That's the real value of that kind
of work.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, I did
my first primitive calculations in '56. And I actually calculated one test,
Bernalillo, which we did in '58. That's how I got into the underground business,
and that was strictly due to AI Graves, who recognized the necessity to go
underground. There are a lot of people who don't realize that we were doing the
initial work for underground tests as early as 1956. Now, remember, we didn't do
that until ‘63, totally.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One theme that was
present in the early underground experiments was that there was a definite
self-interest for the Laboratories' test organizations in reducing the fallout
from the shots. There was a need and a desire to reduce the fallout off site,
and to respond to the mounting public concerns, but also there was the need to
reduce the local fallout in the vicinity of the shot itself for operational
reasons.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Campbell</span></b><span class="calibre12">: The first thing we
at LASL did in a hole was called Pascal-A. It was 500 feet deep, in a cased
hole. We put the bomb in the bottom of it, and we didn't stem it. So, we fired
it. Biggest damn Roman candle I ever saw! It was beautiful. Big blue glow in
the sky. I was up in the CP office, and that was fired from a little handset,
out at the B-J Y.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre12">: You mean somebody
sat out there, and as I've seen in Tom Mix movies, pushed the plunger to blow
up the dynamite and foil the Bad Guys?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Campbell</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Well, pretty close
to that, but not quite. He had a little hand firing set. The shot was in Area
3, down by 3-300. The firing point was the nearest timing station of any size
to Area 3, and so the shot was between the people out there and the CP.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bill Ogle
was out there, in that timing station. When he saw that come out of the ground
he knew he couldn't come south the way he came north, because he was going to
get into trouble. Bill was more excited that evening than I ever heard him
before or since. He was really excited about how they were going to get back.
They went way out east on roads that didn't exist, came back around into Yucca
Lake, and came in that way. You've heard people say, "His eyes bulged out
like a stomped-on toad"? That's what Ogle looked like when he came into
the J Division office that night. He was really excited, and talked a mile a
minute. They were damn lucky they didn't go right through that cloud.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Why didn't you stem
it?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Campbell</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Didn't need to. We
did have a lid on the hole. Nobody's seen that since. We never did find that.
On that lid was one of Johnny Malik's detectors, and we wanted a line of sight
to see if we could measure some of the reactions. There was a kind of plug in
the hole. It was a couple of hundred feet off the bottom, as I remember. All it
was, was a concrete cylinder with a hole through the center of it, so the
detector could look through. And it had an annulus, so it wouldn't bind
anywhere going down. It was suspended from the harness that was holding the
bomb. It was a collimator, not a plug that was supposed to stem the hole. We never
found that collimator either, and it was about five feet thick.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We had a
half dozen of those holes drilled in an arc around station 3-300, our alpha
station. We were in the business of making the transition from towers that were
looked at from the station. All our scopes were in there, and we were trying to
get something where we could use the same recording gear without having to move
it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But
anyhow, bad as it was, spectacular as it was, there was only about a tenth of
the radiation on the ground around there that there would have been if we had
done it on the surface. And we considered a factor of ten reduction to be
wonderful. We thought we had made a real gain. A factor of ten meant we could
get back, and get set up and fire again more quickly. We were very happy with
the results, and we did it all over again on Pascal-B. That one doesn't stick
in my mind like that first blue one. That was our initiation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The
reduction in off-site fallout was an effect that was appreciated by the AEC,
and the people who worried about offsite safety. What we were worried about was
being put out of business if we had too many people pounding on the gates. And,
we wanted to reduce the local fallout, the contamination of the area that we
were using.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jumping
ahead to the moratorium, it turned out that we had a little money, and we
drilled holes against the day that we might come out of the moratorium. We
really thought that was the direction we were going to go.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bob Brownlee, who had
been asked to look at the possibility of firing shots underground, helped to
design the Pascal experiments, and attempted to approach the problem in an
orderly fashion. That was sometimes difficult.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Our first
underground tests were done in '57. There was Pascal-A, and Pascal-B, and Pascal-C.
And there were several others in '58, during Hardtack II. AI asked the
following question, “If I take a 48 inch casing, and I put a bomb a couple of
hundred feet down, by how much will the fallout be reduced?" We discovered
it was a factor greater than ten. And that was just an open hole. So, he then
said, “We put some plugs in the hole, does that cut it even further? And if so,
how much?" So we did that. Then he said, “Let’s put a plug right down on
top of the bomb, and then let's put a plug half way down. Does that make any
difference?" And yes, it does a better job if you put the plug right on
top of the bomb. “Well, suppose we put in some dirt. Does that help?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We
started exactly that way. We were still doing atmospheric shots, so the question
was a very simple one. “If you do this, or that, how much will you cut the
fallout?" And we determined that experimentally. The answer to the fallout
question was, “We’ll measure it and see." On the other hand, the
calculations I did calculated the time the shock would get to the top, what
kind of top you might put on the hole to hold things in, what would the
pressures be there, how big might the cavity get, how does it cool, and what
happens to all that pressure? Does it lift the ground? Those kinds of questions.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pascal-B
and Pascal-C had plugs, but Pascal-A did not, although it had a concrete
collimator in it for the detector at the surface. The guys had been working
trying to get it ready, and there had been a number of troubles. They finally
got it down hole, by my recollection, about ten o'clock or so at night. There
wasn't much time to go back into Mercury, go to bed, and get up the next
morning to shoot it, so somebody said, ”Why don't we just shoot it now, and
then go in?" And it was the world's finest Roman candle, because at night
it was all visible. Blue fire shot hundreds of feet in the air. Everybody was
down in the area, and they all jumped in their cars and drove like crazy, not
even counting who was there and who came out of the area. Today it would give
the Test Controller and his Panel total apoplexy - they would become totally
insensate.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It wasn't
done quite as logically as I have indicated, but there was a thread of logic
from shot to shot. We saw what happened on one, and decided what to do next,
but in the meantime we would have another one. So, the chronology is not as
perfect as you'd like to think it was.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One of
the things we were annoyed about in '57 and '58 - I remember being annoyed, and
I say we because I think there were a number of us - was that we'd do an
underground shot, and the radioactivity from an atmospheric test would be
floating by at such high levels we'd never know what came out. The object of
the underground shot was to see how much we could reduce the fallout, but we
couldn't differentiate that fallout from the fallout of the atmospheric shot,
which was so much greater. So, I thought, "Why in thunder are we doing
this? The whole object is to find out what happened on this underground shot,
and after it's over we don't know whether it leaked or not, or how much. This
is absurd. Why don't those guys knock it off?" I remember having that kind
of an attitude, and I think there were several of us that were annoyed. But the
right hand usually doesn't know what the left hand is doing, and all that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the Livermore
Laboratory, stimulated by the Teller and Griggs report, work was being done to
fire a low yield device in a tunnel, with the object of completely containing
all the debris produced. Gerry Johnson was in charge of the Livermore testing
program, and was the Livermore Test Director.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Johnson</span></b><span class="calibre12">: It was becoming
increasingly difficult to carry out tests in Nevada because of the fallout
constraints, and the public furor over the fallout. There was a rising public
concern that kept growing through those years. In Nevada, from an operator's
point of view, we were only interested in getting the developmental
information. Actually, 1956 was when we began to think about underground shots,
and we were interested from an operational point of view. We felt if we could
go underground and get the data, then we could treat it as an extension of the
Laboratory. We'd go out and shoot whenever we were ready to shoot, without this
big Task Force and large numbers of people, because as you know, underground
shots are pretty dull to look at. And the duller the better.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Somebody said, “Watching
an underground shot is like watching a submarine race."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Johnson</span></b><span class="calibre12">: I've never heard
that, but you're right. That's a good way to put it. One of the big questions
we had was how to seal the tunnel, but out of a lot of stewing around the Rainier
experiment was finally designed, and we fired it in September of '57. And it
did contain.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Rainier event was
fired in B-tunnel on September 19, 1957. Even by today's definitions, Rainier
was successfully contained. The dragon was caged, and his foul breath no longer
polluted the air. Considering the lack of knowledge at that time about the
phenomenology of an underground detonation, that fact is somewhat remarkable.
After Rainier, perhaps containment even seemed easy. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
hubris: n. Excessive pride, arrogance. From the Greek.</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile, two
different paths were leading to changes in the way in which nuclear tests were
conducted. Since the Bravo fallout problems, opposition to continued testing
had been increasing in the United States, with wide publicity given to the
anti-testing or anti- bomb views of Linus Pauling, Albert Schweitzer, Paul
Jacobs, and others. There were anti-bomb demonstrations in England, West Germany,
and Japan. Politically, the issue of testing arose during the 1956 presidential
campaign, and influenced the steps that were being taken to negotiate a
disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. In August of 1958 President
Eisenhower announced that United States would suspend testing for a year once
test ban negotiations were begun on November 1, 1958, in Geneva.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Hardtack
operation had been conducted at the PPG from April to the middle of August in
1958. With the announcement of a moratorium to begin at the end of October,
Hardtack Phase II began some thirty days after the last shot in the Pacific.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During Hardtack Phase
II Los Alamos conducted six safety shots in unstemmed holes, with yields
ranging from zero to a few tens of tons. These events in unstemmed holes were
not designed to be completely contained; the objective was still to reduce
contamination in the immediate vicinity of the ground zero, and to experiment
with various plug and stemming locations and configurations.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Livermore did seven tunnel
events during this period. There was one tunnel event which introduced those
people interested in containment to the possibility of an unexpectedly high
yield, or as some people might say, the unreliability of designers. Neptune was
fired on October 14, 1958, as a safety experiment with an expected yield of zero,
but with a possible yield of 10 tons or so. It was fired in a tunnel, with a
working point that was under the sloping face of the mesa, with a vertical
distance of 110 feet to the surface, and a slant range of 100 feet to the
closest point of the mesa. The yield of 116 tons was unexpected, the shot
vented, and produced a crater. The fact that some of the radioactivity was
released was not of real concern; Hardtack II was, after all, principally a
series of atmospheric shots, and the day before Neptune the Lea event, with a
1.4 kt device suspended from a balloon, had been fired. The Livermore people,
showing considerable flexibility in their thinking, promptly called Neptune a
nuclear cratering experiment, and in a future report, (UCRL-5766 The Neptune
Event; A Nuclear Cratering Experiment) discussed the "major contributions
of the data to the theory and prediction of cratering phenomenology."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre12">: In '58 Livermore
fired a shot, called Neptune, in a tunnel. It turned out that it gave somewhat
more yield than was expected, and it vented out the side of the mountain.
People have said to me, "That Gerry Johnson, he was probably the world's
foremost optimist. We don't know how he did it, but he could take a disaster
and convince everybody it was a great success. On Neptune he just didn't pay
any attention to the idea that the shot was supposed to be contained. He said,
'Well, that's our first nuclear cratering experiment.'"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is that a true story?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Johnson</span></b><span class="calibre12">: Yes, that's
correct. I was told the maximum possible yield was ten tons. That was the
absolute tops. So we designed it for ten tons, and it went a hundred or so.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was a
lousy cratering experiment. It was on a sloping hill, but it was a point on the
curve. But you're right - you'll find that listed with the cratering shots in
the Plowshare program, and it had lots of analyses done on it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gary Higgins, at
Livermore, was beginning to explore the possibility of collecting what were
called prompt radchem samples. The thought was that if some kind of pipe could
be designed that would be emplaced in such a way as to look directly at the
device, allow a flow of some very small fraction, but no more, of the device debris
to a collector on the surface, the expense and time delay of the post-shot
drilling for samples of the device debris could be avoided. Dick Heckman was
part of the group that was to field and collect the samples which might be
obtained.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Heckman</span></b><span class="calibre12">: We started off with
a few of the safety shots. The one incident that I remember in particular was
the Neptune event, in Hardtack Phase II. There was about a one-inch diameter
pipe which ran down into the roof of the room. The hole was drilled vertically,
preshot, and this one-inch pipe was inserted and grouted into place. We had a
plywood box built on top with a two foot by two foot aircraft-type filter
material with the appropriate screen, and with just a discharge on up. With the
yield that was anticipated, everything should really be kind of nice after the
shot.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We then
backed off down to the Area 12 CP. I requisitioned a pair of binoculars, and
braced myself on my vehicle so I could spot in on the location. With binoculars
I could see the little sampling box, and since our success hadn't been all that
good on safety shots, I thought if something were to happen, maybe I could
follow the trajectory of the box so I'd know where to go and find it. The event
went off, and the yield was quite a bit higher than they expected. As a matter
of fact, that was one of the first cratering shots that the Plowshare program
takes credit for. The binoculars did no good, because the ground shock hit the
surface, raised a dust cloud, and I couldn't see a thing.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I got a
bunch of radiochemists, and we went up and we saw the filter box was there, in
the crater. I argued like a Dutch uncle, and got permission, which in
retrospect was a dumb thing to do, but I got permission to get a rope tied
around myself, and to be let down into the crater. We were pretty motivated in
those days.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So I
crawled down, and indeed found the filter box. I tore the filter paper out, but
the pipe had shut off and so we had no sample. Now, when I was given permission
to go down into this crater, it was, "Under no circumstances will you go
into a field which is greater than 1 R per hour," because they expected
this big fallout.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well,
going down there with my survey meter, I found out that the activity was
incredibly low - a few tens of mR per hour. In hindsight, as a result of
attempting to do that recovery, we got some very important information that really
excited some of the Plowshare people. When I came back and reported this, Vay
Shelton and Gerry Johnson happened to be down there at the time, and their eyes
lit up. It was sort of, "You've made the discovery, clearly you would want
to publish the paper.” At this point, the sampling system didn't work, so as
far as I was concerned there were other things to worry about. But it was my
crew in that recovery who were the first ones to discover that it was possible
to do a cratering shot and trap the gross radioactivity down in the ground.
Remember that all the previous experience had been with military cratering
shots, which were underburied.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two of the tunnel
events in the Hardtack II operation were designed to give appreciable yield,
Logan, fired two days after Neptune, produced about five kilotons, and was
successfully contained. Blanca, fired on October 30, 1958 produced 22 kilotons,
and like Neptune, but in a more spectacular fashion, vented out the face of the
mesa.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Logan event was
interesting for several reasons. It was an event in a tunnel, designed to
investigate the effects of the nuclear radiation on various materials. There
was a horizontal vacuum line-of-sight pipe which extended for 150 feet from the
device, opening to two feet in diameter at the far end. From there two six-inch
diameter pipes extended another 75 feet. The design team started with some
money, with very little Laboratory manpower support available due to the heavy
shot schedule already planned, support from some contractors, a pad of blank
paper, a tunnel that was still being dug, and six weeks to design the
experiments and the diagnostics, fabricate the hardware, and have everything
installed for the shot. That is an incredibly short time scale by today's
standards. And, Logan was successfully contained. Arnold Clark was the project
physicist for Logan.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Clark</span></b><span class="calibre12">: We had six weeks,
because we had to shoot two weeks before, the end of October. We were going to
shoot in a tunnel, which hadn't been finished being dug yet, where an important
shot, Blanca, was going to be shot in another part. So, they had to have two more
weeks after we shot to finish off the cabling for Blanca. They would finish
digging out a side drift place for us, and they'd pull cable for us. Our
biggest problem was that we wanted a vacuum pipe in the tunnel; Here we were,
starting with a blank piece of paper, and we had five weeks to have that pipe
finished, installed, and pumped down.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
They
said, "How long do you want it?" We looked at our blank piece of
paper, and said, II A hundred and fifty feet." "How big around?"
"Oh, about this big," making a circle with our arms. And that was the
process we went through to specify it. So, we had a 150 foot vacuum pipe,
maximum diameter of two feet, made by NRL in Washington. It was flown out,
installed, and evacuated. And it held a vacuum! In five weeks!</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lockheed
made a very fancy, very strong steel sample holder to put at the 150 foot
station. Then people had second thoughts about that station, and said, "That
is not going to survive. Or maybe it's not going to survive." They didn't
know. "Maybe we better go out farther." So, we extended the pipe by
adding two pipes, 6 inches in diameter, to the back end of the big one, to go
out another 75 feet. And that's all that survived; the 225 foot stuff. We never
saw any of that 150 foot station after the shot. That was where the container
of very special steel, made by Lockheed, had been. It was a huge thing, about
the size of a really good-sized safe, just essentially solid steel. And it was
a very special steel alloy that was supposed to survive. Well, it didn't. There
was very little from that station.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We had a
quite elaborate closure on the front end. There was a very fine theoretical
physicist, Harold Hall, working for Montgomery Johnson in early '58. They were
worrying about this containment problem, and Harold came up with the idea of a
Box A type closure, as they call it now. This was a brand new idea. Harold Hall
did some calculations, and so did Montgomery Johnson, and they said, “Ah,
yes!" So a Box A type closure was used for the first time on Logan, and it
worked very well. I think the front end was a foot in diameter, which is pretty
big. Maybe it was ten inches.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When they
were digging back after the shot they also drilled back at different areas
around the zero room, and found that the really highly radioactive area, I
guess you would call it the cavity today, was pear shaped. It wasn't circular.
Some activity had come down the tunnel, but not very far except for a few
cracks that went out as much as 150 feet. So, it did contain completely.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However,
it knocked in the side of the drift where Blanca was supposed to be, and there
wasn’t time to clean out that drift, so instead of being shot underneath the
mesa where it was supposed to be, Blanca was shot beneath the very steep face
of the mesa, out where the overburden was maybe half of what it would have
been. I watched it, and I thought the side of the mountain was going to come
right towards me and hit me. I was only two miles away.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The days of
unrestricted atmospheric testing at the Nevada Test Site came to an end on
October 31, 1958, at midnight. As midnight came and went, Livermore device,
ready to be fired, hung suspended from a balloon, and there it remained until
the balloon was brought down and the device removed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Duane Sewell, who
later became the Deputy Director of the Livermore Laboratory, was the
Scientific Adviser to the Operations Manager for Hardtack Phase II, and made
the recommendation not to fire.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sewell</span></b><span class="calibre12">: We left one device
unfired, and I remember that night very well. I had about fifteen hundred
people who really were upset with me because I didn't tell the AEC to go ahead
and fire that device. I told them not to fire it, because it was obvious we
were going to have trouble, but not from fallout. The wind pattern was in a
direction that was not going to give us trouble, and that last shot was a
balloon shot, so there was not going to be a great deal of dirt picked up, and
local fallout from that. But the wind pattern was such that there was a
potential for a pressure impulse into Las Vegas that was strong enough to
possibly break plate glass windows. We obviously didn't want to hurt anybody,
and didn't want to break windows either.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We were
testing with shots of a half ton of high explosive mounted on one of the hills
a short distance from the CP. We'd fired a number of those during the evening,
and it was a double bounce. The shock wave bounced down around Indian Springs,
then the next bounce was into Las Vegas, and it was rather sharply focused. We
had trouble getting enough high explosive; I was blowing up all the high
explosives on the site to make those measurements every half hour to forty-five
minutes. The scheduled deadline was midnight on October 31st, Halloween night. I
remember a lot of masks around the place.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dodd
Starbird was the Director of Military Applications at the time that operation
was going on. I got on the phone with him, and I said, "That's midnight
Washington time, not Greenwich time when we start the moratorium." We
agreed on that. That gave us an extra five or six hours. When it got to that
point I said, "No, it's really midnight here," and I got him to agree
to that. Then I tried to get him to agree to midnight within the United States,
which would mean Hawaii, but he wouldn't buy that. He wouldn't go that far, so Pacific
Standard Time was what we finally had to go on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We fired
the last HE shot about eleven-thirty that night. I was in the microbarograph
room, and we had people out in the field with mobile measuring systems. The
people there called in and said, "My God, what did you fire that time?"
It really shook them. Apparently we had them just at the focus, and I thought,
"Boy, if a half a ton can be heard that far, I'm not going to fire."
The last thing we wanted was to have any sort of damage, or the potential of
harming people in Las Vegas. That's why I made the decision I did. I advised
Jim Reeves not to fire and he went along with it. That's why we left that thing
hanging on the balloon that night.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Louis Wouters was one of the Livermore scientists waiting for the shot to be fired.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wouters</span></b><span class="calibre12">: We ended up with
one shot, Adams, being The Last, the last of that particular series. It was
going to be shot on October 31st, but something didn't go the right way, and we
didn't fire the shot. If the politicians had any sense at all they would have
let us shoot it, because it turned out that two days later the Soviets went
ahead and fired one more shot anyway, after the beginning of the moratorium.
They weren't as picky about those things as we were.</span><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-67"></div>

<h2>Chapter 2: The Rainier Event</h2>
<br>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first nuclear detonation that was designed to be completely contained was the
Rainier event, fired in B-tunnel in Rainier Mesa on September 19, 1957, during
the Plumbbob operation. It had a yield of 1.7 kilotons, and for the first time there
was a nuclear detonation that did not release radioactive material into the
atmosphere.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During
the test moratorium that started in 1958 there were extensive explorations of
the cavity region and the surrounding materials. It was from the information
obtained during these reentry operations that many of the early ideas of cavity
formation, growth, size, and so forth originated.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gerry
Johnson was, at that time, the Test Director for Livermore events, and was the
person who caused the Rainier detonation to take place.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Johnson</b>: The
operational constraints, which were increasing each year, were bugging us, and
we were looking for a way out. Then Teller and Griggs did some back of the
envelope calculations and said, "Look, it ought to be possible to shoot a
shot underground, and if you had a thousand feet of overburden, you probably could
shoot a few kilotons or so." I was interested in that, and I said, "Well,
we'll examine that. We'll get some people looking at it and thinking about it,
and see what comes out of it." Which we did. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span class="calibre10">That was in '57. The Teller and
Griggs suggestion was about a year previous. They wrote a memo on it,
describing the concept. Two of the big questions we had were whether you could
contain it, and would the radiochemistry be any good. As usual, we got into big
arguments with Los Alamos on all issues from technical to cost.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chemists here felt
they could do the chemistry. We had questions about the sampling. We didn't
know if we'd have a pool of molten rock, or what we would to get into. Before
the event we had lots of speculation on what would really happen. There were some
calculations made in terms of what you might expect in ground shock, and
surface motion, and so on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We choose the site based
on topography. We decided on a tunnel geometry because we thought that would be
the best way to do diagnostics. And that's how we finally ended up with Rainier
Mesa. We ended up in tuff, which was good stuff to dig in, but we didn't know
anything about it. We didn't know what tuff was when it was first mentioned to
us.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then we began to get
into public information trouble. A number of us were interacting with the
geophysical community, which we always had done, for all sorts of reasons. Dave
Griggs made the suggestion, "Look, if you are going to fire a shot like
this, for the first time we'll have a shot closely coupled to the ground. We'll
know the yield, we'll know the coordinates, and we ought to make this
information available to the geophysical world, so they can take advantage of
it. In fact, you ought to announce it ahead of time."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we went through
this, and were told to hold the time of firing to a tenth of a second at some
predetermined time, which we agreed to do. If for any reason we were delayed,
and couldn't meet that time, we agreed to wait twenty-four hours and try again.
And we published this. That was fine. It was very altruistic and lovely, and in
the right spirit of technical cooperation. But about a month or six weeks
before we were going to be ready, an international geophysical meeting took
place in Toronto, and by then this event was getting lots of interest on the
part of the seismic geophysical community. At this meeting some guy made some
statement about Livermore planning to fire an "earthquake maker," and
it hit the headlines, and of course got the Atomic Energy Commission's attention.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>:
"AEC TO FIRE EARTHQUAKE BOMB!!!" I can see the headlines.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Johnson</b>: That's
right. Well, that did it. Strauss, who was then Chairman of the AEC, called and
said, "What in the hell are you guys doing out there?" I said,
"Nothing."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I went in to talk
with the Atomic Energy Commission, and I said, "We've gone through all the
calculations of what the seismic effects might be. This is a very low yield
thing that we're trying to shoot; 1.7 kilotons." That seemed quite small
to us. "And we've done all these calculations." Strauss said,
"That's not good enough. I'll tell you what you've got to do before I'll
authorize this shot. You have to assure the Commission that the shot itself
will not cause an earthquake. Number two, that it will not trigger an
earthquake, and number three, if a natural earthquake occurs at the same time,
you have to prove you didn't do it."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we put together a
committee. We got Perry Byerly, somebody out of Cal Tech, I guess Dave Griggs
was on it, a fellow named Roland Beers whom none of us knew, and somebody from back
east. They met. And we told them what we were going to do, and the whole thing,
and Byerly's first remark was, "You shouldn't be so presumptuous. One
point seven kilotons? That will do nothing seismically." I said, "I'm
not arguing with you."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called up Strauss an
appropriate time later and I said, "We've gone through this thing. This
board of experts got together, now we want to come in and talk to you."
Strauss said, "Who's on that committee?" I told him, and he said,
"I don't want any West Coast people on it." This was a setback,
because the West Coast seismic mafia was most of it. It turned out that the
only guy who was acceptable to them to be at this presentation was this guy
Roland Beers, whom we didn't know.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beers came to the
meeting. He was a soft-spoken guy, and didn't seem to know what was going on. I
thought, "We've lost the shot." I muttered to my partners, "I don't
think we're going to win this one. I don't know this guy; he didn't say
anything when we were meeting, and I don't know who he is."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we go assemble with
the Commission and have the meeting. I go through my pitch, describing the
experiment and so on, what we were doing, and what the conclusion of this panel
was. Strauss then looked at Beers and said, "Beers, what do you think is
the largest explosion that you could safely fire in Nevada, underground?" I
thought, "Oh God, what's he going to say?" And he said, so quietly
Strauss could barely hear him across this enormous table, "About a
megaton." Strauss said, "What!" Beers said, "About a
megaton, sir." That was all he said, and Strauss said, "You fellows
get out of here. The Commission and I are going into an executive
session." Which they did, and they decided favorably. "Okay, but be
careful."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So off we go, and by
then the furor had gotten to the state of Nevada. The day before the test
somebody from the Governor's office came to the Test Site to serve an
injunction on the AEC to stop the shot. The Governor said, "We'll hold the
AEC directly responsible for any damage to public works in the state of
Nevada." He wasn't going to take any responsibility. Well, bless Jim
Reeves, who was the AEC Area Manager for the Site. The day the guy came out to
serve the summons, Jim had to make extensive surveys of the upper end of the
Test Site. He was unreachable.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Well,
he was just doing his job. He has to go see what's going on, once in a while.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Johnson</b>: Sure,
he's the Manager. And we were going to fire the next day.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a technical
advisory board, with respect to the containment. These were vulcanologists,
geophysicists, I don't know who all, but distinguished people. The night before
the shot we had a final review. Shall we go ahead, or is there something else we
should do? And the conclusion was everything is fine, go ahead.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We arrived at the CP
early in the morning; I forget what time we were to fire, but it was during
daylight so we'd get good photography. I was there, and one of the members of
the advisory group came up. We were about an hour away from firing. This was a
fellow named Fran Porzel, who was an expert in ground shock, and shock
measurements, and so on. He was from Battelle, in Chicago. He came up and said,
"Gerry, I'm nervous about that tunnel, about the containment. There are
only thirteen feet of sandbags in there." I said, "Oh yes, we all
know that." He said, "I'm not sure that's going to hold."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then he began to
pace back and forth. And he kept talking and walking beside me. He said,
"Can't you just hold the shot for a few days? We'll go back in and put
some more sandbags in." I said, "How many sandbags would you put in?
What would you do?" and so on. Well, he wasn't sure. I said, "Well,
Fran, I'll tell you. We've worked on this thing for a year. We've had the best
advice we could get, including last night. If we open that tunnel up to do anything,
we have to start over, repeat all our dry runs, and check everything out again.
We'd have to do everything. I don't know how long it would take us to get it
straightened out so we could get back to a shot day. And this is the end of the
operation. We're holding the operation to get this shot off, and it's an
experiment. We could easily lose the whole thing, administratively, and I don't
want to do that."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said, "You know
if that blows out, everybody here will say they knew it was going to happen,
and it will be your neck that will be out." I said, "Well, that's my
job. But there's just no way that I can see to postpone. We're committed now.
We have to go ahead." I said, "I appreciate your bringing it up.
There really isn't a choice. If we cancel it now we might not get another crack
at it." But he really put the heat on me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of course, as it
turned out, it worked perfectly, but that's just a bit of history, and he could
have turned out to be right. But we had done everything we knew to do. And God
knows what would have happened if we had shut down. I think if we hadn't fired
at that time we probably would not have gone to underground testing. I think
it's unlikely. The next year we entered into the nuclear test moratorium. We
wouldn't have had time to do a test, set it up, and do enough to learn any more
about it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we did fire it, and
it was well established by the end of the next year, as a technique. We were
lucky in hindsight, as it turns out. The seal was just a simple spiral. We only
had those thirteen feet of sandbags, and a steel door to stop gases, but the
stemming worked perfectly. We got overconfident later and had some problems,
but Rainier did work very well.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as it turned out, we
recovered the radiochemical samples. The rock had frozen right away because the
cavity collapsed, so we never did find molten rock. But we were concerned about
tapping into molten rock. The question was, "How can we test that
out?" Naturally we went to the vulcanologists, and they told us that no
one ever drilled into a molten zone. The way they got their samples was to wait
for the molten rock to come to the surface so they could scoop it out in a
bucket.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About that time there
was an eruption on Kilauea Iki in which a pool of lava some three hundred feet
deep was formed, and later a thin crust about a twenty feet or so thick formed.
So we sent some guys from the Lab to drill through the crust and collect
samples, which they did. They only had to drill through twenty feet of stuff, but
to get to a suitable location they had to walk out on this crusty lava flow for
several hundred feet. Don Rawson headed the group out there. They had a
contract driller and crew, but they were with them. That experience convinced
me that at Livermore you could get somebody to volunteer for anything .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Gary,
when did you first became involved in the containment business?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: It was
at the Laboratory, not at the Test Site, and it was almost coincident with the
firing of Rainier. Gerry Johnson, who was then the Division Leader of the test
organization, I think then called Test Division, was working with Bill Ogle and
Al Graves from Los Alamos, who were deeply involved in the conduct of the whole
Plumbbob operation. Gerry went to Chemistry Division, and what Gerry wanted was
someone to look into the question of how you would do a radiochemical yield
measurement on Rainier, or a test like Rainier. I was in the radiochemistry
group of the Chemistry Division, and in the heavy elements part of the group.
My responsibility was the separation of the plutonium and transplutonic elements
from the debris samples from the atmospheric shots.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I came into this
picture just about the month Rainier was fired. I didn't know a thing about
what the underground effects of a nuclear detonation would be, so I thought I
would go talk to some experts, who obviously would know. And so I began to talk
to experts at Los Alamos and at Livermore. It turned out that all of the
experts had not come to a consensus. There was a range of expectations. At one
extreme was the prediction, or guess, that Rainier would produce a bubble of
molten rock about a meter in radius, and that the debris would all be contained
in that lava.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: But
Gary, you can just look at the calories available and know that there will be
more molten rock than a few tons.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: You'd think
so. At the other extreme there was the expectation that there would be
something like a 100 meter void, and the debris would be contained in a thin
shell of glass lining that void. This was about the period of time when the
French science fiction writer, Camille Rougeron, who made his living selling
these Jules Vern type ideas to the popular press, published an article that said
if you detonated a nuclear explosion underground, in rock, you'd get a glass
bubble full of steam, and you could then power generators with that steam for a
very long time. That was before we'd ever done anything in the Plowshare
program.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Who were these experts you
talked to?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Gene Pelsor was the one in
Livermore that I particularly remember, because his prediction was, within the
uncertainty of the yield, correct about both the size of the void that would be
produced, and the approximate amount of shock-melted material. His arithmetic,
the details of how he arrived at the numbers were incorrect, but with self-canceling
errors there were enough wrong things that his conclusions ended up being
pretty close to right.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: If you have enough wrong things
some of them will make the answer too big, and some of them will have the
effect of making it too small, so you might come close to the right answer?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes. The guys who were really
far off were the ones who made one mistake and got everything else perfectly to
maybe four significant figures.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the people who
made an estimate was Stanley Ulam, at Los Alamos, who was a theoretical type
person. He made one very simple mistake, and I'm inferring this from what other
people said, he did not say this to me. His error was to neglect the
vaporization of rock, in that he went directly from a solid to a Fermi gas, and
back to a solid. That neglects the region of condensed molecular gases. Half
the energy of vaporization of rock is in the phase transitions from solid to
vapor. There's another half that takes the rock from vapor to ionized gas. So,
the first half is a very important step function in the pressure-volume
relationship, but it's easy to leave it out because nothing very important
physically is going on except the change of phase. That was the small estimate.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very largest
estimate came from Bill Libby, and his was not very different from Gene
Pelsor's. The reason it was larger was because he did not leave any strength in
the solid. Gene let the solid be an elastic solid forever; what Libby did was
pretend it was a liquid with a back pressure, but no strength. The way to say
that correctly is to say he used a Poisson's ratio of 0.5 instead of 0.3, as it
really is. Which is kind of a dumb thing, but that does make the cavity get bigger.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: He
would have been correct if Rainier had been fired in water.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: Yes. It
would have been precise in water until the rebound occurred. Rebound occurs in
water too, and it causes a recompression, so the bubble rings. It oscillates
with a period that is proportional to the depth, which is a kind of restoring
force.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: If the
energy from the device wasn't going to melt much rock, where did they think
that energy was going to go?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: Well,
you and I think it's self-evident that there would be a lot of melt. But,
naively, people thought that all of the energy would go out in the seismic
wave. If you fired a kiloton explosion you'd get a kiloton seismic wave. If the
earth were perfectly elastic, that's what would happen. But it's not perfectly
elastic, and that isn't what happens. It's rather fortunate that only something
like one part in ten to the fourth of the total energy ultimately gets into the
seismic wave as energy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span class="calibre10">Dave Griggs, who has passed away,
was active in the seismic community, and was the author of the first paper that
made an absolute calibration of the seismic magnitudes of earthquakes translated
into energy. It was based on the nuclear explosions carried out in the South
Pacific - I believe it was the 1954 series. If the conversion were not so
small, the convergence of the waves at the antipode of the explosion would have
been sufficient to cause an eruption, like a volcano.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was if all the
energy had gone into seismic energy. The people in the seismic community had
calculated that if all the energy went out around the world and came back into
the same place at the antipode, and none of it were lost, there would be
another explosion. It wouldn't be any bigger than the detonation, but if the energy
went out one hundred percent elastically, it would be as big as - or a little
smaller than - the original explosion. So all you would do then, if you wanted
to destroy a target, was to go to its exact seismic antipode, fire off the
appropriate energy device, and say, "Who, me?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: That
sort of thing sounds like the days of the high altitude tests, where the
thought was that you would detonate a device at some altitude here, and all the
ionized particles would going running down the magnetic field lines and cover
up the enemy's radar over there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: Right.
You got it. But the business of the earthquake, and the elastic world was a
real concern. They still compute the elastic equivalence of earthquake yields
as the absolute magnitude. If you take the elastically coupled value for a
magnitude six earthquake, it's way less than one kiloton. And so there was real
concern that one kiloton, if elastically coupled, would be like a magnitude
seven earthquake. A magnitude seven earthquake, it causes some damage. But the
real world is not elastic, which is of some annoyance to those who like to
calculate things, because it would be much simpler if it were.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time Rainier was
fired there was a group of consultants who were assembled, ad hoc at first, and
then that group was formalized more or less, to advise the AEC, or the Manager
of the Nevada Operations Office, about such matters as safety. Dave Griggs was
on that committee. He got in by being in the seismic community, and being an
Air Force consultant. He brought George Kennedy along because George had been a
student of George Morey's, and knew about the melting of rocks and so on .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: People certainly knew some
things about the response of the earth, because for years and years lots and
lots of people had set off thousands and thousands of explosive charges. All
kinds of sizes, and in all kinds of places, and they knew the earth didn't
respond that elastically. So what were these people in such an uproar about?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, precisely the same thing
that they were in such an uproar about on things like Three Mile Island. It was
the unknown feature. And the people involved in the Test Program at that time
really weren't in the same community as the people who had all of this
experience with high explosives. There were a few individuals who carried that
experience over. One was a guy named Roy Goranson, in the very early days at
the Laboratory, who had spent a lot of his life with high pressure steam, and
steam explosions, and equations of state of water and rocks.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span class="calibre10">Gerry Johnson had the experience
of working with artillery in the Navy, and he knew from his experience what the
detonation of a thousand pounds of TNT would do, and how it would scale. He had
HE experiments done prior to Rainier. They tried to produce containment, and
discovered one of the differences between TNT and nuclear, which is the
residual gas.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't contain high
explosives unless you can also contain lots of residual gas. For every pound of
high explosive, you produce a pound or so of residual gas. In a nuclear
explosion the rock vaporizes and does all of its mechanical work, then as soon
as it cools off it goes back to be some kind of rock again, and the gas
pressure is gone. So, the containment of the nuclear debris is a much simpler, although
more sophisticated, problem than the containment of a high explosive charge.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's really extremely
difficult to contain high explosives. People in oil fields and in mining are
painfully aware of that problem. For that reason they have criteria for safety
and for detonations that are very different from those for the safety and
containment of nuclear explosions. The difference is understood by a few
people, but most people who grow up in one community don't comprehend the problems
that people in the other community face.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People who have grown up
thinking nuclear containment cannot understand why the oil field people want
explosives with the highest possible specific energy with the lowest possible
residual gases - they're extremely fond of nitroglycerine, for example, which
is terribly hazardous to handle. So you say, “Why don't you use something like
ammonium nitrate? It's a lot safer.” And they say, “Yeah, but we can't get
enough in there to shatter the rock.” “But why do you want to shatter the rock?
That just makes little tiny particles, and they'll plug up. What you want are
fractures.” They say, “Yeah, but if we do that, it blows out the top of the
hole.” “Well, then why don't you stem it?” “Oh, you can't stem it.”</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They don't shoot stemmed
shots. They put the explosive down, detonate it, and let it blowout. They don't
try, because they have never been successful in containing the gases.
Therefore, they don't use some of the most valuable products of the explosion.
The high pressure gas would do them more benefit than the shockwave, but they
don't use it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, back to the rocks.
It was difficult to select which expert to believe, except I could reject there
would be no bubble. All of them shared one thing; there would be molten rock,
and I believed that. The first conclusion I came to was that it was reasonable
from all points of view to expect the debris to be in fused rock. And if the
molten rock cooled, there would be glass. If it stayed molten, then the
question would be how would you sample it., The obvious answer was, you would
need to drill into it. But, without measuring we had no idea how complete or
how good the samples would be, or how efficient or effective the sampling would
be .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had some fused rock
from the ground surface of a number of near-surface bursts, including Trinity,
so we could do the chemistry on fused rock. We had done all of those things
with samples picked up from the surface. But we had no idea what concentration
of debris to expect in the samples we hoped to get. We didn't know whether we
were going to need a gram or a kilogram. And that, of course, depended on how
much rock got melted per kiloton. We did do some sensible estimates, again
using Gene Pelsor's calculations primarily.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe Gene was asked
to attempt to fully contain the explosion. Not maybe for the reasons that we
want it contained now, but that was his objective. The stemming procedure on
Rainier had been designed as a rather elaborate spiral buttonhook. The philosophy,
expressed in different ways by different people, was that the radioactive
debris would be charging around the tunnel at velocity V, and by the time it
went around the spiral, the seismic shockwave would have come across and closed
off the tunnel, trapping the radioactive debris. The placement of the sandbag
plug, I believe, was to stop jets. The idea that the buttonhook would achieve
containment neglected a lot of things. It worked for all the wrong reasons, but
it worked, that one time at least, very well, and it established that
containment could happen. I believe that a lot of Gene's work was not
recognized as being as good as it was, considering how little anybody really
knew.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>:
Somebody wanted to try to contain the shot, and that was probably Gerry
Johnson.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: Yes. I
think it was Gerry, although Al Graves had made the statement, before this was
done, that we weren't going to be able to continue to carry out atmospheric
nuclear tests forever, and we really ought to find an alternative method. He
didn't say it should be underground, or in deep space, or how. There were actually
four ideas that were kicked around in '56 and '57.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Underground was one,
deep space was two, deep ocean was three. Under the ice cap, either in the
Antarctic or under the Greenland ice cap, was the fourth possible way of
carrying out tests without contaminating the environment in any gross way. We
might criticize the ice cap or the ocean ways as contaminating, but at that
time, in that period, that looked like complete containment.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, Rainier was fired.
The next thing then was to find someone who could drill into it. In the fifties
a lot of our drilling was done by contract drillers, and most of the early
drilling underground was by E. J. Longyear people, and people that they hired.
The Longyear people were having real difficulty, because the drillers had to be
cleared; you had to have a green badge to work with the radioactive debris in
those days. To find drillers that they could get a long enough history on to
get them a Q clearance was not easy. Drillers, by habit, or choice, or
circumstance, don't stay in one place for very many months at a time. They go
from crew to crew, and place to place, wherever the work is good and their fancy
takes them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diamond drillers, who
are a group that we found were experienced in the small drills we needed for
the underground rigs, were used to doing ore deposit definition for the mining
companies all over the world. So, most of the drillers we had were non-U.S. citizens,
which made it even harder to get clearances for them. We had a real problem
getting three men to handle each of the three shifts - actually it means four
shifts because we were going to go seven days a week.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding that number of
drillers who were Q-cleared was really very difficult. Add to that the gossip
that was going back and forth in the union halls, or in the beer halls maybe,
about the possibility of thousands of pounds per square inch of steam, and such
high radiation that they'd be sterilized forever. One fellow told me he was told
that the samples they would recover, if they ever did get to where they were
supposed to, were going to be so radioactive that the whole crew on that shift
was going to be killed. Well, it makes it real hard to get people to do that,
no matter how much you try to convince them, or talk about what to expect. And,
we weren't all that sure ourselves. We knew the business about the
radioactivity wasn't true, but beyond that we didn't really know what the conditions
would be when we got there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal8"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>:
What was your role on the reentry?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: People
didn't have administratively designated roles in those days. My role was sort
of keeping tabs of what was observed, and reporting it, and asking questions. I
talked to the drillers, and the geologists. We had a geologist by then, and the
Geological Survey was involved. And I did chemistry measurements. A lot of
those. I still did that part of it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our first attempts were
to go into the tunnel, establish an alcove, and drill horizontally. I found out
drills don't easily do that; they don't drill horizontally, because the drill
stem droops. So, there was the issue of, well, where is the drill?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we had penetrated
the radioactive zone in the tunnel we had started drilling from the surface,
but that was 860 feet up. For reasons I've never been able to understand, they
cored all the way from the surface instead of just drilling in, and then
switching to a core bit. The communication between ourselves and the
construction people in the field was not good. Perhaps we asked them to core from
the surface, not realizing that they could very easily switch from a spade bit
that would have drilled much faster and have gotten down to the ground zero
zone very early, to a core bit.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the hole from
the surface never intercepted any of the radioactive debris because it came out
in the chimney, and all the drilling fluid ran out of the hole. The drillers
maintained that they could not drill without fluid because the drill bits would
not survive if there was no fluid in the hole. In those days they didn't have
reverse circulation drilling. They only had forward circulation, which meant
that the fluid came out behind the bit. So, if there was nothing around the bit
to confine the drilling fluid, it was not cooling the bit; it was cooling the
rock wherever it ran to. We really had to learn the drilling business before we
could ask the right questions, and we didn't know them then.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also found out that
the progress in drilling in the tunnel was painfully slow. The drill would be
turning around and around for days on end, but it never got anywhere. I found
out the reason that it wasn't getting anywhere was that the drillers didn't
want it to. As I said, there were rumors, including the one that this cavity
might contain thousands of pounds per square inch of steam.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, Gary, the drillers felt
they were going to drill into a volcano, filled with radioactive steam and
molten rock. Would you want to drill into something like that, which would spew
all over you and kill you and all of the members of your drill crew?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Of course not. So, they would
turn the drill, but they'd never push. We had a huge cavern worn out of the
side of the alcove into the tuff, but it went in only a few feet. I think there
was a lot more gossip and misinformation than we in the Laboratory ever heard.
I do know that there were drillers who would make all kinds of excuses for not
going on that particular drilling crew.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flangas</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, there was always some
concern over the unknown, but for those of us who came out of the mining
business, we were used to some risk. Now, there is certainly a difference between
intelligent risk and recklessness, and some of us know the difference. Gary
Higgins became an integral part of that crew, and I personally had a great deal
of confidence in his judgment and his experience. He didn't try to butt into
the actual mechanics of what we were doing, but he was there to advise us on
the things we didn't know about. It was a very, very close relationship. We
trusted him, and his judgment was good.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: His
story is that it took a long time to drill back into the cavity, because the
drillers weren't very anxious to get there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Flangas</b>: There
may have been some of that - some of the miners were that way. Occasionally you
would run into somebody who would be a little bit spooked, but once it was
explained to me, and I had a fairly decent grasp of what to expect, and as long
as the leadership was confident in what they were doing, our people just followed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, finally, after a couple
of months of drilling, and I think it was close to a year after Rainier was
fired, because we didn't start immediately, the drillers penetrated,
unexpectedly, a radioactive zone. That got radioactive debris into the tunnel,
and we had to shut down because the rad-safe people said, "You've contaminated
everything here." It was great news to me, but sad news to the drillers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went down and tried to
find some of the debris, along with some of the people from the NTS-LLL
contingent. We finally sorted out a bunch of sand and stuff, and when we took
it all apart a grain at a time we could find some little black pieces of glass
that seemed to be more radioactive then the rest. It was radioactive enough to be
an annoyance, but not a big enough sample to do any kind of measurements on.
Maybe we could have, but we didn't try. But the key thing that had happened was
that we had penetrated into a radioactive zone, and there was no high pressure
steam in it. Now, it was hot - it was hot enough so if they shut off the
circulation water it would almost boil. The water that was coming out was too hot
to hold your hand in. But the drillers then had great confidence it wasn't
going to erupt, and so, within the next two weeks they finally hit a mass of
lava. It was black frothy rock, and they got cores of it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We found a piece of core
that was gray and gunky, but it had a radioactive peak in it. And I said,
"I wonder why that is?" So, I put a rubber glove on and squished it.
I found little glass beads that were pendant shaped. From the shape, and the
fact that it was now solid glass, we could infer that it had been hanging from
something at some time. We said, "If it was hanging from something, it
must have been in a void space. It was liquid, and it has the shape of a liquid
drop, so there couldn't have been anything against it."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so we began to
reconstruct that after the cavity had grown underground it had stood there for
a little while - at least long enough for these glass beads to solidify. By a
process of reconstruction we worked out about how long that had to have been.
We confirmed that by measuring the ratio of some of the gas-precursed radioisotopes
that were included in those glass pendants to </span><span class="calibre10">what </span><span class="calibre10">they
were in unfractionated radioactive debris. It worked out that it was something
between one and a half and four minutes that this glass had been pseudostable.
The whole thing stood there before the roof caved in.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also looked at the
amount of water that was dissolved in the glass. Roy Goranson had produced a
table, and published it back in the thirties, of the solubility of steam in
silica glass. If you quenched a glass in water at ten bars of pressure, what
percent of that glass would be water, and how much water would remain as vapor?
He had the whole table of solubility of water in silica glass, and we got the
pressure of the Rainier cavity as being about 45 bars. We observed that 45 bars
was not all that different from the overburden pressure, at that depth of
burst. If one hypothesizes that the steam expands until it's in equilibrium
with the external pressure, then all of the pieces balance. So, that became an
adopted hypothesis for containment; that the cavity size is such that the pressure
would equal the overburden pressure. It turns out that's probably not right,
exactly, but it was a good working hypothesis. We now say stress instead of
pressure, and it is probably even correct.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rainier cavity was
about fifty-five or fifty-six feet in radius. That was the size it would have
been if the material in the first meter or so, around the explosion, were
transformed into steam and other gases, and they expanded until the pressure
was somewhere near the overburden pressure. That was the concept of a balloon,
or bubble, blowing up inside a pile of blocks, with no rock strength involved, and
that was pretty much what the model was that was used for a lot of the early
evaluations of containment. It's wrong, and it's wrong in a lot of different
ways, but it was extremely useful.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a year or so after
Rainier the Hardtack II series started, and we sampled several other
underground shots - Logan, Blanca, Evans, Neptune. We did not explore, in any
detail, any of those shots. We simply drilled enough to get rad-chem samples.
We were still going into the tunnel and drilling horizontally.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: When
you were drilling horizontally, were you then getting your samples from the
bottom of the cavity, or from the sides?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: They
came from the bottom of the cavity. From what we discovered on Rainier we
designed the scaling law that says the radius of the cavity is 55 times W to
the 1/3 feet, with W, the yield, in kilotons. That was where we found the
puddle that gave us a good, big sample. So, the target we drilled for was based
on design yield and 55 times W to the 1/3 feet. We usually aimed a little above
that, with the idea that if we missed it on the high side, as the drill
progressed across the cavity it would go through the puddle on the far side.
And we would carefully log, and almost always saw two blips on the
radioactivity versus depth of penetration plot. And we then said, "That's
the cavity boundary." And on the far side we'd say, "Well, the drill
probably carried some radioactivity along with it, so the far side is probably
a little too far." So you subtract a little from that, and do things like
that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those measurements were
recorded, of course, and people began to say, "My, isn't this interesting
that these things scale together?" Then they said, "What is the yield
that you get from the cavity radius by using the 55 W to the 1/3 feet law
backwards?" It wasn't very good, but it was a number.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We went through Plumbbob
and Hardtack II without really understanding anything about containment. After
Hardtack there was the moratorium, and during that time we did the post-shot exploration
of Rainier, in great detail. That was to measure accurately the boundaries of
the chimney region and the cavity region, and all of the physical parameters of
the shot. We wanted to measure things like the temperature, integrate the
thermal energy, and locate where all of the energy was deposited permanently. We
balanced the total release, as we measured it from the rad-chem yield, to the
thermal energy to within about 92 percent or so. We inferred that the energy
that went into producing fractures, which we couldn't measure, was in addition
to that. The seismic energy then was some number that was very small, which from
measuring the seismic wave you could also say was true. So, in a sense, we
balanced the total energy of the shot to within the precision of the various
measurements. Which is a satisfying thing for scientists to do.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We began to understand,
in the course of those drillings, where the radioactive debris was distributed.
Not only the kind we wanted for the rad-chem samples, but also there were, in
these logs of radioactivity versus distance, blips that were clearly at larger
radii than the inferred cavity radius.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You did find cavity material at
some distance from the cavity boundary? Did that material go along bedding
planes, or did you think there were fractures in the rock itself?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, we didn't recognize
bedding planes then. We did recognize faults. And there was a huge fault not
far from the Rainier shot point. At the time that the tunnel was mined some
drift in the B tunnel complex - I believe it was 12B-02 &ndash; was terminated. It
was designed to go into the mountain a little further than it did, but it ran
into this fault that was so large that you could look down it. You could
literally bend over and look in, and here was this hole in the mountain that
went off in the distance and you couldn't see how far it went. It was a real
fault, not like the things we map these days; it was empty. What we did was
back up from this big open fault and mine the button hook, and they put the
muck from the ground zero room down into the fault. And it just disappeared
down there. We didn't have to haul it out to the portal of the tunnel. That was
a big fault.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason I bring the
fault up is that in the post-shot exploration that we did in such detail, we
found that the center of all of the energy, both the radioactive radius from
ground zero, and the thermal regime, was displaced by a couple of meters toward
the fault. It was clear that the presence of that fault influenced the growth
of the cavity, and there wasn't real symmetry. One would like to say everything
was symmetric about the detonation point, but it really wasn't.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also found that if
you looked in detail, this cavity that we were fond of drawing with a compass
as a nice sphere really had bumps and wiggles, and had cracks that went out.
Some of those cracks were filled with various and sundry bits of what had been molten
rock. We also found evidence of enough hot vapor having gone out into some of
the fractures to change the color of the rock on each side of the fracture. It
had boiled water out of the rock, but there was no melt there. So, we knew that
the simple picture of a glass lined sphere, like a Japanese fishing float, the
kind you see hung in the seafood restaurants, really wasn't what the inside of
the cavity looked like. It was really pretty bumpy and wiggly, and&nbsp; probably
very leaky.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we had the first
core holes we saw the blip on each side of where the cavity was, but when we
mined that out we found a jumble of slabs. They were mostly planar slabs of
melt-covered rocks, folded over each other. When the geologist identified where
these slabs had come from, it turned out they had come from a hundred or so
meters above the detonation point. Then we began to have a picture that there
was the growth of the cavity, then a pseudo-stable period when it sat there and
nothing happened except some leaking of the high pressure gases pushing out,
and then slabs and bits and pieces falling in, jumbling in helter-skelter, and
the steam being quenched by pieces that were fairly large. It was not a hail of
small pieces of sand, but pretty big pieces that were falling in, and the steam
probably migrated some distance upward. In fact we found evidence for some gas
radioactivities in the rubble three or four cavity radii above the detonation
point.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: This
picture you're giving of these slabs of material falling in doesn't fit very well
with the accepted picture of a collapse. “The geophones were quiet, and then it
collapsed, and the collapse progressed upward at whatever feet per second.”
It's not exactly a plug falling in, but it occurs very rapidly, and the picture
is that the layers of rock would still be basically intact, just displaced down
some distance. You don't describe anything like that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Higgins</b>: No.
That's right. What we observed, and I would say in an almost differential
sense, was quite different from what we inferred from the readings on the
instruments. And I see still a discrepancy between the detailed reentry mining
observations from Rainier, and from the general picture we get from the
observations of cables breaking and from the surface. I think that discrepancy
still exists to a degree. And you identify it very specifically.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would put this point
up, and it's one that has disturbed me and continues to disturb me. We have
only investigated in great detail one event, and that's Rainier. We've never
investigated in great detail any other one event. In the first place it's quite
costly. It cost us about as much to do the kind of post-shot investigation that
we did on Rainier as it did to fire the shot in the first place. So, it like doubled
the cost.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I must say that in
recent years the line-of-sight pipe tunnel explorations have in some respects
exceeded the information that was learned from Rainier. But it is not so much
about the containment of the shot as about the containment of the pipe, and the
phenomena associated with the pipe closure. When I said we've never explored
another shot in such detail, I meant in all the containment aspects in general.
In other, detailed areas, I think DNA has exceeded Rainier by quite a bit.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, you had the moratorium
going for you, Gary. People didn't have anything else to do. We wanted to keep
the miners busy, we wanted to keep Gary Higgins busy, and so we let them go dig
around in the mountain.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Precisely. And keeping the
miners occupied was a very important thing. During the moratorium a number of
professional people decided to abandon the Test Program. That disturbed a lot
of people who felt an obligation to maintain the defense posture that we had
because of our nuclear weapons capability. And so they asked themselves,
"How far can this loss of personnel go before we lose the capability to
resume, should we decide to resume?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a number of
answers to the question, but among the answers that emerged was the fact that
there were other skills than physics and mathematics and chemistry that we
would be losing, and one of those was our mining capability and our drilling capability.
Both of those skills had evolved well beyond, and different from, the common
industrial practice. In other words, any miner wasn't adequate. Or any driller.
Witness the fact that we'd sat there and turned to the right with no forward
progress on that first Rainier hole for two months or so. It was a question of
having other kind of skills that were as important as the scientific skills.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, during the
moratorium, we spent a lot of effort trying to understand what had happened in
the Rainier cavity. The business of what goes on in a cavity went through a
history like that in a lot of technical fields. There was the first evaluation,
and a simple model was generated, or invented, or selected from among a lot of proposals.
That model fit a lot of observations, so we said, "Okay,&nbsp; we understand
this part of the explosion phenomenology. We won't devote much time to doing a
lot more investigations, because they are very difficult to do."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they are difficult
because the stress levels within the area where the cavity is formed run not
just to kilobars, but to megabars and above. So, the measurement techniques
must be very sophisticated. The region that's involved is small, and things are
diverging very rapidly in space, so any measurement instrument has to be kind of
tiny. And everything goes on in extremely short periods of time, so getting
signals that are meaningful out from that region is extremely difficult.
Getting a fast signal out means a big co-ax, and a big co-ax means a big void
or something like that in the very small region. That is kind of contradictory
to the idea of measuring what is happening in that region without disturbing
it. There are a lot of contradictory requirements, or conflicting requirements,
when you try to make such measurements.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: In your work on Rainier there
were probably several things you wanted to do. Certainly you wanted to do radiochemical
analyses to get the yield. What effort was devoted to trying to understand what
happened to the rock materials themselves under the high pressures and high
temperatures that had&nbsp; existed?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The primary charge we had was
to be able to do on underground shots the same measurements we'd been doing in atmospheric
testing. So, that was the primary purpose of our efforts. In order to fulfill
that primary objective we wanted to know something about the mechanics, and the
chemistry, of how the samples we were recovering had been created. The basic
purpose was still to diagnose the performance of the explosive, not to know how
to contain it. The containment concern really didn't come up until much later.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were extremely
curious about what had happened to the native material, and we did a lot of
different measurements. One of the first things we found on Rainier was a lot
of glass, which was the tuff that had been melted and then quenched. We did radiochemical
analyses for a lot of different chemical species to determine how much total
rock had been melted, and how well mixed that melted rock was with the device
components themselves. Those conditions influenced how the device components
would behave after the shot, and what they would be like when we went back and
found the samples. We pretty well knew, from all kinds of laboratory and
atmospheric test experience, what the immediate surroundings were going to be,
and what temperatures and pressures things were going to be heated to. It wasn't
like working in total darkness. We knew that the initial temperatures and
pressures were going to be so high that the material present would be disassociated
into electrons and nuclei, and that there really wouldn't be any material
properties, other than those of a so-called Fermi gas.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That doesn't last long.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It doesn't last even a
microsecond. Some reports on containment describe what's going on in the first
microsecond as if that's a very short time. That's a long, long time compared
to some of the things that go on. The Fermi gas very quickly, in the first tenth
of a microsecond, probably has begun to expand enough so a genuine shock has
developed. That shock is a really strong shock, well above a megabar. The rock
is vaporized by it, and even though the gas may not be fully ionized, it's
still partly ionized, at least once or twice, so the chemistry's still not
important.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere out about a
meter or two meters from one kiloton enough energy has been absorbed, and
there's been enough spherical divergence of the shock wave so the pressure
level has gone down to where the kind of rock that's there is important. In the
model, that first simple minded model, what we used to do was say, "Okay, the
first meter that surrounds the explosion is made out of iron." We had a
fairly good equation of state for iron, and we knew what pressures would be
developed if you shocked iron to ten megabars. So, we started all our
calculations, whether the detonation was in limestone, or oil shale, or Nevada
tuff, or alluvium, with iron out to the first meter. We put the whole energy of
the explosion into that. Of course, if you do that, for most of the explosives
we talk about that means the composition of the explosive itself doesn't really
make a lot of difference.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sphere of iron with a
one meter radius is like ten times pi tons, so you've got thirty or forty tons
of iron to mix with the device. You mix in a small number of pounds of whatever
and it doesn't make a lot of difference. So, that assumption was very useful
for generating the correct shock out in the rock where we could make decent
measurements and the coaxial cables didn't get banged so quick that we couldn't
get the signals out. They confirmed that what we'd done by putting in the meter
of iron was right. So, okay, what was in that first meter didn't make any difference.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of that model is
correct, except that after the material has been shocked, it does something.
It's left behind as very high pressure atoms and electrons, but it doesn't stay
that way. The electrons and atoms that have been disassociated by the shock,
and other things, are going to recombine, and they don't really care what form
they were in before they were disassociated. They go back to a form that is
consistent with their environment at the time they are being born. The
electrons don't care that they were in tuff to start with; they're very happy
going back and becoming methane, for instance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The little bubbles that
were frozen inside the glass on Rainier were micro samples of the cosmos in
which they were formed. You don't know in the stage of expansion when that
glass becomes solid and the bubbles were trapped, but you do know that whenever
it did get solid, it was a closed sample. So, the analysis of those glass samples
showed us a number of things.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We took the glass, broke
it into little chips, and examined them under the microscope to find which had
closed bubbles. We put those in a vacuum system, heated them, and when the
glass melted the bubbles burst, and then we analyzed what the bubbles
contained. It turned out that what was in them was mostly water vapor, which, I
would say, was not surprising.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You refer to the material you
recover from the cavity as "glass." Why do you call it that? It doesn't
look like glass.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: No, it doesn't look like what
we think of as glass, but in fact it is glass. We had established that early
through some work with consultants at the Laboratory, in several ways. One was
to take some of the initial material we had recovered from Rainier, and do physical
measurements on it; measure its density, its index of refraction, and so on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you look at it
through a low power microscope, it is just like window glass. The reason, when
we look at it in a gross sense, that it is all black is that it has a whole
range of size of tiny bubbles in it that absorb all the wave lengths of light.
Plus there are some inclusions of metals, and other things. If you look at it
in a thin section it doesn't look black any more. First, it looks sort of dark green.
As you get it thinner it begins to look yellow, and then when you get it down
very thin it's perfectly transparent. You can see through it, with the
individual bubbles in it visible. Those bubbles are remnants of the steam that
was in excess of that required for saturation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor George Morey
of the United States Geological Survey, who was then in his late seventies or
early eighties, was intrigued with the whole of the phenomenology of the
creation of lava. He had worked for many years as a geochemist, first in the Geologic
Survey, and then after his retirement, at the Carnegie Institute. Then, when
they forced him to retire, he went back as Emeritus Scientist for the USGS.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was very intrigued
with the geochemical processes that go on in ground water, and how hot water
around volcanos and fumaroles really transports earth from place to place at a
very large rate - a lot larger than we mortals, who are here for an instant in geologic
time, realize. If that water is flowing from there to here, it's also bringing
along huge quantities of rock. And pretty soon, as the water evaporates and
goes away, the rock will grow here, and it will grow in whatever form best fits
this environment. Professor Morey spent the last twenty years of his retirement
searching out and quantifying these effects.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, what was going on
in Rainier, and the underground explosions in general, was a rapid speeding up
all the processes he was interested in. So, he was intrigued by the kind of
glass we would form from an ash. Volcanic tuff was spewed out of the ground as ash.
But on Rainier it had recondensed, after the shot, as glass. Why did it come
out to be glass, and not go back to being ash? So he got involved in this study
of the glass.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of his students,
George Kennedy, from the UCLA Institute of Geophysics, also got involved. And
there was another fellow, named David Griggs, who had been involved in the test
program from before Hiroshima and Nagasaki He was the principal geoscientist
involved with the Air Force advisory panel. Professor Morey, George Kennedy,
and Dave Griggs were involved in not only determining that glass was produced
from the condensation of the molten rock, but also in measuring its index of
refraction, and the amount of water vapor that was dissolved in it. From that,
and the radius of the cavity, we deduced what the steam pressure must have been
to make that kind of glass.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To form glass you need
some silica sand. As long as the ratio of silica to the other common earth forming
oxides, such as aluminum and calcium and magnesium, is large, the melt when cooled
quickly from its liquid state, or quenched, will always form glass. The rate at
which that glass changes back to being crystal silica, and alumina, and
calcium, depends on how much silica there is. The more silica the longer it
will stay glass, but it will change. That process of changing from glass to
crystalline form is devitrification.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glass is a metastable
liquid, but it takes a long time to devitrify, and for silica glasses that time
is measured in hundreds of thousands of years. At the concentration of silica
in the tuffs at the Nevada Test Site, the glass would prefer to be crystalline
quartz plus feldspars, but the process takes around five hundred thousand to a million
years. Those tuffs, as we know from many lead isotope ratio studies, and the
fact that they're there as minerals and not as glass today, are like two,
three, four, up to tens of millions of years old. Even so, there are still
remnant glasses from the original volcanic outpouring. Not a lot, but there are
some.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A nuclear explosion
converts the rock close around it to glass, with minor, minor exceptions. And so
the generic term is that the “glass” is the initially molten material, from the
shot, that cooled very quickly. The amount of glass produced is like a kiloton
per kiloton of yield, and that's not too surprising. The energy in the nuclear
explosion is just about right so one kiloton of energy will make one kiloton of
molten rock. And that's what we find out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going back to what goes
on the cavity, the other thing we found in those little bubbles in the glass
was hydrogen, and oxygen, and a little bit of carbon monoxide, and a little bit
of carbon dioxide. There really isn't much carbon in the tuff; there wasn't in
the Rainier ground zero area. But, the timbers that held up the tunnel were wood,
and all the electronics had rubber and plastic insulation, and plastic foam as
a dielectric. If you added it all up, there was enough carbon in the environment
to explain the carbon dioxide in the bubbles.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, how did the carbon
get from plastic to carbon dioxide? Well, if you have this big sea of electrons
and atoms, the atom doesn't know whether it came from plastic or rock. A lot of
what's around is water, which is hydrogen and oxygen. So, the carbon has a high
probability of combining with either oxygen, or even more probably with
hydrogen, because there are two hydrogens for every oxygen, so hydrogen is the
major material around. So, when you put hydrogen with carbon, you get methane.
The carbons have some affinity for each other, so a lot of them go around as
two's. And when two's go together, then you get ethane. Sometimes there's an
oxygen, so that makes methyl alcohol, or methyl formaldehyde. A whole suite of
hydrocarbons gets formed, not because they were there as hydrocarbons to begin
with, but because it's probable that they're going to become that in this sea
of mostly oxygen and hydrogen with the occasional carbon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More frequently than
carbon there's a silicon, or an aluminum here and there, but not many. For
every four oxygens there's one aluminum, or iron, or silicon. So they go back
together, and then as they cool they continue to react with each other. One of
the things that Russ Duff has noted, and I think he is onto a very important
clue, is that what is happening in the cavity, even at long times, like months,
is that these gases are finding each other and reacting.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A not very probable
reaction, but an easy example, is where a methane finds a water molecule, a
steam molecule, and reacts with it. The oxygen from the water will go with the
carbon in the methane, and two hydrogens will get formed. This happens at only very,
very high temperatures; as the temperature cools, that reaction goes the other
way. Water and methane are the natural products, hydrogen and carbon monoxide
are the starting reactants. That particular reaction occurs at high
temperatures, but stops abruptly at like 1300 degrees centigrade.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you analyze a lot of
these products, you can look at the ratios of the chemical compounds and derive
a temperature where they must have been "frozen." They call it
"frozen equilibrium," because the rates of reaction are exponential.
There's an old rule of thumb which we chemists use, which is not quite
accurate, but it demonstrates the principle: for each ten degrees increase in
temperature, you double the rate of reaction. So, it doesn't take a very big
change in temperature to have a reaction proceed extremely rapidly, as in
seconds or milliseconds, or extremely slowly, as in hours or days. That change
can take place as the temperature changes a hundred degrees or so.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The simplest ratio that
gives a temperature is the carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide ratio at a given
pressure of oxygen and hydrogen. If you look at the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen
to water, that gives another method of calculating a temperature. If those two temperatures
disagree, then you have a phenomenon you have to explain. It turns out they
don't usually disagree, and they haven't in the tests where we have made
measurements. They all give a temperature which is consistent with the cavity
sample that we had frozen out in the bubbles on Rainier, which was about 900 to
a 1000 degrees centigrade. That also turns out to be about where the melting,
or softening point of the rock is. So, all of this holds together, sort of.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In retrospect it's what
we should have expected, but we still tend to treat the material that the
shockwave traverses near the explosion as if it were iron, or rock, or
aluminum, or plastic. We forget that the world, and the environment around the
explosion, if you average all the stuff together, is almost half water. Normal tuff,
they say, is fifteen percent water, twenty percent water. That's by weight. The
molecular weight of water is eighteen. The molecular weight of rock is like
sixty or seventy. So, if you take twenty percent of something with a molecular
weight of eighteen, and mix it with eighty percent of something with a
molecular weight of seventy, the result is that there are more molecules of
water than molecules of rock. And so, if something is going to react, the odds are
just about even that it is going to react with something from water, and
something from rock. So, anything that's going to happen is dominated by the
water.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing we found on
Rainier was some fragments of glass that were formed by having been blown down
a fracture, which then squished off. We found such a fracture, and again we
didn't recognize its importance. We had this model of a smooth, round cavity
with a glass lining; we ignored the fact that at two and a half cavity radii
was a fracture containing some glass.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We found this fracture,
and said, "Isn't that interesting? I wonder how that glass got down there.
Well, it must have been a fracture." And, everybody said, "Yes, it
must have been a fracture." But in all of the literature you don't find
mention of the glass-lined cavity having spikes radiating out from it,
containing products from the center. In the model we mentally smoothed the ball
off, and forgot that there were fractures from it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point was that in
those fractures were glass fragments that were frozen out while probably it was
still in contact with the cavity, and they had elemental iron, elemental
copper, elemental uranium in them. These metals are extremely reactive. With
this sea of oxygen atoms we should have said, "They shouldn't be
there." But they were there. Again, we ignored that. It was the exception
that should have said our general model was too gross. Chemically, a sea of
electrons is about the most reducing thing there can be. In fact, you couldn't
get the average chemist to comprehend what a mole&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of electrons, just
electrons, would do.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the clues were
there. When the cavity forms dynamically, this high stress shockwave goes out,
running way ahead of the material. And we know, for example, that shock
velocity is greater than particle velocity, almost no matter how high the
stress level of the shockwave is. So, as the shock goes out from the explosion center,
it runs ahead of the material, but the material that is behind it is moving at
still a pretty high velocity. The shockwave is irreversible; it leaves a
portion of its energy behind as heat, which causes this ionization-disassociation
that's going on. There are more electrons around than anything else, so
everything wants to be reduced to the elemental state, and then start
combining. </span><span class="calibre10">Most </span><span class="calibre10">of the atoms that are present are
oxygen, so most things end up as oxides. It may sound contradictory to say that
oxides are reduced, but carbon monoxide is the reduced form, relative to carbon
dioxide, and elemental carbon, or graphite, or diamond, is even more reduced.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the state of the
cavity is highly reducing, and so, for example, if there is copper around the
copper will stay pretty much as elemental copper. You don't see big globs of it
because it's all vapor, and when it condenses, it condenses a few atoms at a
time, dispersed throughout the glass. The black color of the glass is not due
to radiation, and it's not due to carbon; it's mostly due to elemental lead and
iron in the form of single, or a few, atoms. What we should have learned, and
should have known from the Rainier fractures is that there was a period of time
when the cavity was growing, the boundaries were open, fractures were going
out, and the volume being interacted with was considerably larger than that
which we found when we calculated the steam pressure, and calculated 50, or 55,
W to the l/3rd as the cavity radius.</span><div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-69"></div>

<h2>Chapter 3: The Moratorium and the Return to Testing</h2>
<br>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
1958-1961 moratorium followed Hardtack II. During the moratorium Los Alamos
drilled some stockpile holes in Yucca, and Livermore continued with excavations
in B tunnel and E tunnel, in Rainier Mesa. Considerable reentry work and
explorations were done at the site of the Rainier event. And, little known
until many years later, a series of experiments took place which contributed to
the knowledge about containment.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">:There was something that went
on during the moratorium which used to be super-secret but isn't anymore. There
have been announcements about it, and newspaper stories. That was a series of
one-point kind of experiments, and so we had a rather active underground
experimental program here at Los Alamos. You didn't see towers, and you didn't
see smoke, and you didn't see a lot of things. But out in T A-49 we put things
down holes, and fired them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The yields were just the
high explosive yield, essentially, but it was during that period I saw my first
stemming collapses, from a whole series of those things. It always happened.
We'd shoot one of these things off, and a little while later the stemming would
fall down the hole. We were doing them in tuff, so the holes tended to stand, and
the stemming would go down. So, it was during the moratorium that I began to
appreciate chimneys, and stemming falls.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob Newman and I spent
an appreciable time fussing about scaling laws. How big a cavity would we make?
How much stemming did we have to have to keep everything contained? The
difficulty was that the number of people who knew about that program in Los
Alamos was minimal. In J Division there was Westerfelt, Newman, Campbell, and a
few others, including myself. And of course, in W Division there were the
people who were making the devices.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of these
experiments I continued to get an education in containment during the
moratorium, which if you stop to think about it is odd. But it was kept so
close that only Campbell and Newman would talk to me, and they didn't talk to
many others at all. I was not allowed to know very many details. The part of it
that I knew was that we were doing things that required stemming and
containment, and we didn't dare make a mistake. It had to be contained, and we
had therefore to be super-conservative. It wasn't like the Test Site. If
something floats around here in Los Alamos, everybody in town knows it. There's
no way you can escape it. The argument was that we didn't dare go to the Test
Site. I thought that was a bit odd, but that was my understanding. We had to do
it here because the Russians would know we were doing something if we went
somewhere else.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, at Los Alamos we
were learning a little something about underground containment. We talked a lot
about scaling laws. We debated whether we needed a depth of burial where there
wouldn't be a crater, or what it was we did need. My recollection is we kept
debating what it meant, but with people like Campbell in the works those kinds
of subtleties were oft times scorned. Obviously what we meant was that nothing
comes out. So, at those very early times we had already, in a way, defined
containment as not one atom out. There was nobody who told us to do it that
way.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scaling laws you
could find in the literature were, of course, for chemical explosions, which is
actually what we were dealing with, in a practical sense. So they were
relevant, in away. As a result of all that we came to '61 with the conviction
that 400 feet times the 1/3rd power of the yield in kilotons was conservative,
and worked.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, I would say
that more happened during that moratorium that's relevant to containment than
you might think. Even though it was hidden, and there weren't very many people
involved, there was a continuation of thought. I think we were more ready to
test underground than people remember.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were other
activities, at the Test Site, which contributed to the ability to resume
testing, should the need arise. Interestingly enough, this effort, on the part
of both Laboratories, went into the preparation of underground sites, although
the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was still several years in the future.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: During
the moratorium Livermore had the LRL-Nevada people working at the Test Site.
They got some amounts of money, and I presume the los Alamos testing
organization did too. The Livermore people were digging tunnels against the
time when there might be something to do with them. What were the los Alamos
people doing?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Brownlee</b>: We
stockpiled some vertical holes. When the moratorium was over we had holes in
which we could shoot, right away. We had made the decision early on, I think,
that our vertical holes would take a 48-inch diameter casing. To my memory they
were all drilled to accommodate such a casing.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were in alluvium in
Area 3, and the alluvium we saw was pretty loose. When we drilled a hole, there
were layers of what I call hourglass sand - it would flow like the sand in an
hourglass. Any fool knew that you would have to case those holes, or they would
just fill up, particularly if they were going to stand there for a long time.
And so, there was a policy here that you had to shoot in a cased hole, because
you would lose the bomb and everything else if you didn't. After we resumed
testing we used to have that argument with Livermore, regularly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Well,
Livermore shot in cased holes for some years. It didn't occur to anybody to
ask, “Los Alamos drills holes and cases them. Why do they do that? We're in a
different area. Is it the same? Should we do that?" So, Livermore cased
holes. Why? Well, because los Alamos did, and that's the way it was done. I
think that is an interesting example of something being done in one place in one
way for a particular reason, and that becomes dogma. In different place at a
different time the same things are done without regard to the fact that it is
different place, and other ways might be better.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Brownlee</b>: That's
right. Had we started up on Pahute mesa, for example, the dogma would have been
utterly different, I think. In Area 3 we did have the sand flow. In one of the
shafts we put down later, the hourglass sand trickled down between the boards
of the lagging for three or four months. It was a steady little stream, just like
an hourglass. I don't think Livermore has ever seen anything like that in the
north part of the valley.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roy
Miller was the drilling superintendent for Livermore for many years, and had a
different view.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Miller</b>: The
problems that LASL had, and we had, on several holes, was that the
alluvium-tuff contact is where they tended to cave in. There are places where
that sand zone acts like a fluid. It just pours in there like sand in an
hourglass.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have the same zone,
only it's deeper than in the Los Alamo area. As you get up in the northern part
of Yucca Flat, we've had dozens of holes that caved in at the alluvium-tuff
contact. We've repaired a bunch of them and used them; filled them full of
cement and drilled back through.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To give you an example
of how massive those cave-ins are, there was a hole called 10r, back when we
were drilling with air-foam direct circulation. We drilled the hole to 1600
feet, pulled the drilling assembly out of the hole, ran a caliper log all the
way to the bottom, 1600 feet, and were logging up. When the caliper log was at
about 400 feet - you run the caliper log from the bottom up - it was like an
explosion had occurred. Air roared out of the hole like a volcano. I wasn't
there, but the stories that were told about that... It broke all the arms off the
caliper log, but they pulled it on out. Didn't lose it. They repaired the
caliper log, and went back in to 1050 feet, so they had lost 600 feet of hole.
This was a sixty-four inch hole, and essentially this was instantaneous. They
ran the bit back in, cleaned it out without difficulty, all the way to 1650.
Then we pulled the bit out, went back in with the caliper log, and it stopped
at 1050. It did that two more times.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was that hourglass
sand that LASL keeps talking about. The first time it was a massive cave-in.
The other two times it was very slow. They weren't aware it happened until they
went back in. The same thing happened in Area 2 on the west side of the road.
We drilled down to below the water table, and set a liner to have a dry hole.
It caved in above the liner and filled the liner up. We went in, cemented it
up, drilled back down, and fortunately hit the liner. Anyway, those formations
that LASL talk about down there occur up in Area 2 and 10, only at a deeper
depth.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I think we did cased holes in
Area 3 for perfectly rational reasons, in light of the things we were seeing.
It was only after we had this big quarrel with Livermore, some years later,
after they went to uncased holes and were pointing fingers at us for spending
too much money casing holes, that we really examined the fact that even in the
alluvium in Area 3 the holes lasted a long time if you didn't mess around in
them. That was very hard for Campbell to accept.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, during the
moratorium, there was a doctrine to keep the testing community intact.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You might almost call it a
readiness program.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes, you might. And the way
they planned to keep it intact was to let people work on whatever they wanted
to. We had said, before the moratorium, that during the moratorium we would rework
and reduce all the data we had collected in those frantic years of tests. In
fact that really didn't happen. There were a few people who worked on data, but
there were people they didn't want to lose who didn't want to work on data.
They were allowed to work on other things, so in truth, even though people were
around, they had other interests and evolved to other programs.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span class="calibre10">And so, when the moratorium was
over and we went back to testing in '61, we really had, it's fair to say, a
different set of people. Not entirely of course, but there were different
groupings of people, and so there was not a lot of carryover from the things we
did in '57 and '58, as far as containment was concerned, into the '61
time-frame.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Louis
Wouters, by 1958, was one of the senior scientists in the Livermore testing
program, He remained with the program until his retirement. As with the
comments of John Foster cited after, his remarks do not have to do with
containment, but they are interesting to consider in the light of Bob
Brownlee's words about maintaining a testing, or containment capability when
there is nothing to test, or to contain.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wouters</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The day the moratorium started,
L Division ceased to exist in the minds of management. What do we need these
people for? We have no tests to shoot. The general attitude we lived with for
almost a year was, "Well, we're paying them, aren't they happy with that?
We haven't fired them, after all. Good God, what are they complaining about?
They haven't got anything to do except plan, and think, and look a old data.
That seems to us that is an idyllic situation." Well, the kind of guys we
had at that time in Test Division were a bit more motivated and a bit more
ambitious than that, ambitious in the technical sense. They wanted to go out
and do things. They were young men, and they wanted to do things. They didn't
like being cooped up in an office.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first year there
were a number of things to clean up. There was data from Hardtack II, and also
Hardtack I, to get into some kind of shape. Only about half of that work
actually got done, because there was no interest from the design divisions,
none whatever.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it was in 1959
that I went over to England to look into a number of things connected with the
Joint Working Group we had with them, and also go to one of the photomultiplier
plants of EMI to see what they had to offer. The people at AWRE were very nice,
and they took me through their test program building and their laboratories. And
let me tell you, you think we were in trouble. Any of the offices that had
anybody in them - and there weren't many, there were a lot of empty offices -
had a zombie. There was just no motivation. There was one guy who was excited,
because he was working on image converter replacements for cameras, and he was
able to use it on HE shots. All the others, they were just sitting there,
waiting for the worm to turn, or whatever. It was dreadful.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In retrospect, what it
tells you is that it is not unique to us when something like that happens. It
seems to be a universal kind of syndrome. They don't want to spend money on us
because they don't see the point. I, at that time, with a vengeance, came to
the conclusion that if you don't have anything worthwhile for people to do,
close the program down, put them on something else with a long string, and if
the need arises, pull them back. They'll be happier and more useful to you than
if you let them sit and rot in their offices.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John
Foster was the Director of the Livermore Laboratory in 1963, when the Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty was signed. One of the things that was considered to be
important when the Treaty was signed was that there should be a readiness
program - a formal program to maintain a capability to resume atmospheric
testing should such testing, for whatever reason, become necessary. The following
words by Johnny Foster relate to that readiness: not to containment.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foster</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I can remember, when we got to
the atmospheric test ban, going to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and trying to
argue for the four safeguards that had been worked out with Scoop Jackson. The
day I made this pitch to the JCS was the day that Curtis LeMay was, I think,
Acting Chairman. I went through the four safeguards, and the one safeguard that
LeMay hung up on was the one of readiness. He said to me, “You will never be
able to maintain readiness." I was absolutely thunderstruck. Here was the
guy who had created the Strategic Air Command that had maintained readiness,
and he was telling me, "You will not be able to maintain readiness."
I was too shocked to ask him why.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was dead right. Only
a few years later I was working in the Pentagon, (Ed. - as Director, Defense
Research and Engineering) and cancelling the very programs that I had fought
for. I was cancelling them because the plans were made up by people who didn't
understand what they were doing. The people who did had left to go work on
things that would be more productive. And, if the plans didn't make any sense,
you just simply couldn't afford to keep pouring money into them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some
experiments that could be done during the moratorium. In particular, there were
a number of high explosive experiments done to look at crater formation from
various yields of explosives in various media. One notable such experiment was
the Scooter detonation, which was done at the Test Site. It involved the detonation
of 500 tons of TNT which was stacked in a spherical shape at a depth of 125
feet. One of the problems with Scooter was that when the signal to fire was
sent, the TNT did not ignite and so there was no detonation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob
Bass, of Sandia, was the project officer for the various ground response measurements
that were to made.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Bass</b>: We started
putting the HE in the ground in Mayor June. That million pounds of TNT had to
be loaded down 125 feet. We could never do that today. For example, one of the
problems they're having right now with the Chemical Kiloton is how to have a
safety plan for transporting the ammonium nitrate from Mercury out to Area 12.
Don Larson had one of his people find out how they transported gasoline on the
Site, so they could use that plan. Turns out, there is no safety plan for
transporting gasoline, or flammable material on the Test Site, on the Mercury
highway. That's okay, but you can't move ammonium nitrate, because people have
thought about it. And that's the current kind of stuff we're stuck with.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, we transported
all the HE for Scooter, a million pounds, down from Hawthorne in twenty ton
loads on commercial trucks. It came in blocks - it had all been melted and
cast. Hawthorne had so much of that stuff that it was unbelievable. We also had
a whole bunch of spheres made up, and Sandia has used them for containment
tests ever since - two thousand pounds down to eight pounds.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we put in all of
our instrumentation. We had a trailer nearby that had a revetement around it to
keep the air blast from hurting it, and the rocks from falling on it. In
addition to our instrumentation we provided the electronics and the place to
record and handle the firing system performance, and people's checkouts of all
that. I was not responsible for the firing, but in a sense I was involved
because I helped hook up the firing set. Bernie Shoemaker did it, and I helped
him with that. Scooter was to be fired with a pentalite booster block in the
center of the charge. That block was put in when the sphere was halfway
installed. The detonators were sent up from Albuquerque, and they were
supposedly war reserve detonators to be used with a regular firing set, and the
people who did this were the people who would ordinarily do a regular test, a regular
operation. There were extra dets for backups, and so on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trouble was somebody
sent out sugar loads. They were dummy dets that didn't have any booster in
them. There was no active final little blue booster to set off the pentalite;
they just had the little wires across the back. These were what was put in. Everything
was fine, except there was no explosive in the dets. We found out, after they
were in, and the HE was on top of them, what had happened.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, they sent out some
more dets, of the same type. We took them down to our trailer and said, “Let’s
fire these things and see what happens." Bob Burton was in charge of doing
this. The thought was, could we put enough energy in there, to that little wire,
that we would get the pentalite to go. That was the idea, and we tried. And so
we proceeded on. On shot day Neal Thompston, then head of AWRE was there, and
whoever was head of the Atomic Energy Commission at the time was there.
Everybody was there .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: What
you're telling me, if I understand you correctly is ...</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bass</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That we knew damn well it
wouldn't go. We would have been stunned if it had gone. That would have been
the surprise of surprises. We knew it wasn't going to go, but we wanted to try
it, because there wasn't anything else to do. The explosives were all stemmed
in, and it would have been a terrible job to try to get them out. And, as we
expected, it didn't go.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An investigation group
was set up, and Mel Cook, a Utah explosive expert, was called in to head the
committee to see what to do. They met and met and met, and decided there was
only one approach, and that was to melt our way back down. So they set up a
group to do this, and an explosive safety board to supervise it. We could never
do this today, never in a million years.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we did was to put a
safety perimeter around the shot, which was established as soon as it didn't
fire. About halfway back toward the Area 10 highway where the access was to the
area, we set up a remote control area to remotely drill back. We moved a drill
rig in, drilled down to the top of the HE, remotely done. When we got to the
top of the HE, then we put in a steel billet, which had hot water piped to it -
I don't think it was steam; I think it was just hot water - to melt our way
back down, through the explosive, to the center. When this was done, the guts
of the billet were pulled out, and a pentalite booster block was lowered inside
this billet, which now sat in the middle of the Scooter charge.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was scared to death of
the whole operation, but we were out there monitoring all the time. We were
also worrying very much about our instrumentation cables, because we had all
these storms and rainy periods. We were using white field wire, which was just laying
out on top of the ground. It wasn't waterproof wiring at all, so we ended up
with almost complete shorts in all of our cabling, in addition to the shorts in
all the amplifiers, which were ruined.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we sat there, burning
out all our cabling, all this time. And we also had some cabling that went into
the HE to measure the HE burning rate. There were concerns about how much
current we could put into the cables and not be a danger to the HE, and all
that. So, we had to monitor the things very carefully. A lot of thought went
into it. We sat there with low currents, just burning out these cables for
three months. We were in the danger area, burning out our cable the whole damn
time. And they dried out finally. All but the pressure measurements.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what did we end up
with? We ended up with a lot of radial accelerometer data that was outstanding.
We ended up with some good horizontal velocity gauge data. We were using the
old SRI-Sandia DX velocity gauge, which was capable of outstanding
measurements. It's not used anymore, because it's far too hard to use. There
were some surface measurements too. We made some surface velocity measurements,
and there were all kinds of photography done. Scooter was really a very good
experiment.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There were a number of HE shots
during the moratorium.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bass</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes, and Sandia was doing all
of those. There was the Buckboard series in hard rock, for instance, during
that period. And there were a lot at Fort Peck. There is a lot of stuff in the
literature on those, but there is very, very little instrumentation data.
Mostly there are photographs of before and after, and throw-out measurements -
sticky-paper trays, and things like that. Vortman put out beads all over
everywhere, and they counted beads in various samples they took after the shot.
There were a lot of people, including ones at Livermore, who got very excited
about how the crater lips were formed, and that sort of thing. Cratering was a
big thrust. Vortman was digging canals, out on the Yucca dry lake. I stayed as
far away from that program as I could; I wasn't too interested in that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moratorium on
testing ended in September of 1961. Following the atmospheric detonation of a
Soviet device with a yield of over 50 megatons as the first of a series of
Soviet atmospheric tests, President Kennedy ordered the resumption of testing
at the Test Site. There was the proviso that the tests should be carried out underground,
unless a specific exception was approved. The first event at the NTS following
the moratorium was the Livermore 2.6 kiloton Antler test, fired on September
15, 1961 in a tunnel. It was followed by Shrew, a Los Alamos safety test in a
drill hole, fired on September 16, 1961. Both events released measurable
amounts of activity; the activity released from Antler was detected off site,
that from Shrew was not.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the next few
months the experience of both Laboratories showed that the containment of the
radioactive materials produced by an underground detonation was not a trivial
task, whether the device was emplaced in a tunnel, or in a drill hole. The
first eleven events all released activity. During the first year there were 43
shots fired in emplacement holes by Los Alamos and Livermore. One, Eel,
released some 1,900,000 curies, and the activity was detected off site.
Twenty-one released material that was detected only on site. Twenty-one are not
recorded as having released activity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When the moratorium ended Los
Alamos used drill holes for their shots, and Livermore did their shots in the
tunnels. Was there any kind of agreement, or understanding that Los Alamos would
do shots in drill holes, and Livermore would do tunnel shots, so there would be
experience with both ways of doing the experiments?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I don't know that there was
anything like that. Probably there was no reason for it at all. But, at the
time I thought there was a reason. Our perception at Los Alamos, and mine,
which came a lot from AI Graves, and some of AI's obviously came from Norris,
was that Los Alamos had concluded it didn't make any difference what the facts
were, peaceful uses of nuclear energy would never come to anything. If
Livermore wanted to waste their time with Peaceful Nuclear Explosives - PNE
things - that was Livermore's prerogative. But we at Los Alamos would, as a
matter of policy, not devote any of our thinking to PNE type things, and
tunnels smelled of PNE.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our interest was bombs,
and testing bombs, and for that vertical holes were quite sufficient. If you
were going to make harbors and things like that you had to have answers to
certain kinds of questions which tunnels helped you answer. But everybody knew-
Los Alamos thinking - that the best place to test bombs was right where we
were; Area 3. So, don't go near those mountains where who knows what evils
lurk. We'll stay right here, thank you. So, the impression I had was that PNE
was what separated them. Now, in fact, I do not know what Livermore was
thinking, and I do not know whether PNE figured in Livermore's thinking or not.
I don't know. But I think that's kind of how we saw it, early on anyway.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to
remember, but it's probably totally incorrect, that I was a bit more objective
than some of the other people at Los Alamos. I was never quite so quick to pick
up the party line. I always got along well with Livermore people. But there was
a party line; thou shall not go near Livermore people, because they're all
terribly bad. When I got permission to go to visit Rainier I was the only Los Alamos
person who went and mixed with the Livermore people. I didn't mind that, but
there were other people who didn't approve of that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I'll tell you a story I heard
about why Los Alamos never had tunnels. I can't vouch for its truth, but it
goes like this. Once upon a time Norris Bradbury visited the Test Site, during
the moratorium. Livermore was busily digging tunnels, having nothing else to
do. As part of Norris' tour of the Site, Livermore people took him to the tunnels.
They got into one of the little mining cars and rattled back into the tunnel,
which was poorly lighted, wet, noisy, dirty, and all the sorts of things
tunnels sometimes are when mining is going on. When they came back out Norris
said, “My people will never work under those conditions." And that was
that for tunnels.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's entirely consistent with
Norris. I can believe that. That's the way Norris was. But it's also consistent
with what I told you; tunnels were unnecessary, unneeded, and we would do our
work in vertical holes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I was always very
curious about the tunnels shots. I had seen those sandbags in Rainier that had
turned into rock, and the other things that had happened in the tunnel, and I
thought that was very interesting stuff. I went up and visited whenever I
could, which wasn't all that often. Campbell, for example, didn't approve of Livermore,
or tunnels. If you were going to drive up there you better not let Campbell
discover that you drove one of his AEC cars up there. You had no business being
up there. You were supposed to stay in Area 3. So, whenever I went there I was
either on the q.t., or I had some special dispensation. I don't know that there
was any reason for that. That's just the way it was.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the Russians terminated
the moratorium. Incidentally, I believe that was done perfectly legally. You
hear that the Russians violated the agreement. I believe the understanding was,
“We will tell you before we shoot again.” And they did. They told us the day
before. I think they did what was perfectly legal in the eyes of the State
Department. We had the same option.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They certainly didn't
try to conceal it. But Kennedy was irate, and he called here and said,
"How soon can you get a bomb off?” We must have gotten that call the first
week in September, and I believe our answer was, "We can do an underground
shot in one of our vertical holes in a week./I The problem was, that was in no
way a quid pro quo. To do a few kilotons in an underground shot in Nevada was
certainly not equivalent to fifty megatons or so. But, that's what we were
ready to do, that's what we said we could do, and Shrew, our first shot, was
not very long after that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point is, we were
ready to do that very quickly because we did indeed have vertical holes ready.
And, we knew, or guessed, how big a yield we could fire in them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, through '61 and '62
we did some shots, and we were gathering information. Before we had the
underground treaty in '63 we had satisfied ourselves that we could get the
necessary data we wanted by testing underground. We had gotten enough
information to know how to do that. And that was due to AI Graves, and Campbell,
and Newman, in my view. I would name those three people as having done the
necessary thinking and preliminary work to allow us to go that way fairly
easily, and in a straightforward</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">manner.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One
of the projects that was significant for containment was the attempt by people
at Livermore to develop a way to collect so called prompt rad chem samples. The
concept was that there would be an open pipe running from the device to some
collecting station on the surface outside the tunnel, or by the top of the
emplacement hole. There a sample of the device debris would be collected, essentially
at the time of the detonation, and returned to the Laboratory for analysis. The
work following the moratorium was basically a continuation of the work Gary
Higgins had started during Hardtack II.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There
is little question that this effort led to at least two major ventings. Dick
Heckman, a chemical engineer, was in charge of the field effort to design the
pipes and other hardware that were to collect these samples .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Heckman</span></b><span class="calibre10">: After the moratorium I went
back to the underground sampling business. There was what I called the fast sampling,
which was an attempt to get fast, or prompt samples, where what I was trying to
do was to get refractory bomb debris. In other words, the kind of bomb debris
you would normally get from post-shot drilling, where the activity is trapped
in the melted rock, which is the standard sort of thing. What I was initially
trying to do was develop a competitive process to that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You did your first tries on the
shots that Livermore did in the tunnels, like Antler? You were the guy who was
ruining the containment on those?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heckman</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes. Well, I didn't have
anything to do with Antler's failure, because we didn't have time to get the
sampling system set up. I think that you have to give Mike Heusinkveld a lot of
the credit for the ideas. In other words, I'm only guilty as being the field
guy who carried out the concepts that Mike had.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Gnome there was such
an experiment, a fast sampling experiment. We had a vacuum system with a pipe
ten inches in diameter down to the shot room. It was a beautiful straight,
vertical hole. You could go down into the shot room at Gnome, look up through
that pipe, and at noon you could see stars. It really does work. You could see
stars.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You know, I've heard that
story, and I have done a little simple-minded calculation about the solid angle
and what fraction of the sky you see, and how many visible stars there are, and
the probability of there being a star in that patch of sky is so small that I
don't believe you.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heckman</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Fine. I understand all your
arguments, and all the rest of it, but I was there, and my recollection is I
saw stars. I'm convinced I saw stars. Anyway, the point is that is was very
straight.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It was straight, I know that.
You could look from top to bottom. Did you ever look down and see the stars
down at the bottom?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heckman</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I have acrophobia. I don't like
to look down much.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span class="calibre10">So we had the sampling pipe, and
fortunately, it didn't work. We had enough problems on Gnome as it was, but if
that sampling pipe had really worked, we could have had another Des Moines.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: On Gnome there was a ten-inch
diameter hole pointed directly at the device. It went to the surface, and it
was open all the way. It not only sealed up, but we probed the inside of it
with a radiation detector down to within two cavity radii, and were unable to
detect the fact that there had been a nuclear explosion there. There was no
activity, not even gaseous activity. To me that was, and is still, rather
surprising, because there was plenty of tritium tracer around the Gnome
explosion, and it was everywhere else, but not in the rad chern sampling hole,
believe it or not. It certainly went into the tunnel.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, there were people, Gary,
and I'm sure you're familiar with this, who believed that the way to ensure
sealing and containment on cables and small diameter holes was to always, on all
drawings, and when discussing them, speak of them as rad chem sampling devices.
Then, the evidence was, nothing would ever come up them. You'd never see an
atom.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Not even one. You're right, I'm
familiar with that approach.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heckman</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The concept behind all of this
sampling work was that the bomb was going to go off, some of the debris would
fly into the pipe, the ground shock would then squeeze off the end of the pipe,
and now I would have a pressure pulse, and it would be just like a shock tube.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These were vacuum pipes
that looked directly at the device, and so you put a slug of gas in, and it's
equivalent to puncturing an aluminum diaphragm and allowing a pressure wave to
travel down the pipe. You can very easily show that if indeed it behaves like
that, with the pipe shut off by the ground shock, there's a certain maximum
pressure wave that will arrive at the other end. So you design a system that
will withstand that kind of pressure.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chemical engineers
devised several ingenious schemes to keep the pipe open, and Dick Heckman
describes what was done on Eel, in May, 1962, and on Des Moines, in June, 1962.
Both were major ventings. The reported release on Eel was 1.9 megacuries; on Des
Moines, II megacuries.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heckman</span></b><span class="calibre10">: My good friend Heusinkveld
wanted to use slifers as a way of getting a quick yield measurement, and he
came up with this great idea where he just drilled a satellite hole, filled it
with drilling mud, and stuck his slifer cable in it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: And the mud was going to keep
it open?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heckman</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, he didn't think about
what the mud was going to do. He just knew the mud was going to transmit the
shock wave as it went out. On that same shot, which was Eel, I had decided that
maybe I could get an explosive that would get detonated by the shock wave. I
wanted something that would burn pretty slowly, and nitromethane logically
comes to the fore. And so we indeed did that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, Mike's slifer
cable worked fine, but immediately there was this 150 or 200 foot high column
of mud that spewed out of his slifer hole. Our sampling system worked and we
got samples out of it, but it didn't close off either, so Eel would have vented
even if Mike's slifer hole hadn't been there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were not looking at
the device itself. These were now satellite holes. People said that the device
goes off, and the cavity grows out in this length of time, and our thought was
that if we could connect up with that initial vaporized zone, we'd stay
connected. Then we could build very sturdy systems that would take the thousand
psi or so of pressure, with cyclone separators we could bury underground, and
then we could pull samples out of them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we tried a straight
nitromethane tube, but what we found there was that when you look at the burn
velocity of the nitromethane, it burned faster than the ground shock coming
through the alluvium. We probably were exploding the pipe; we were putting pressure
inside at the wrong time. So then we had them wind us up a helical pipe, where
the spacing on the pitch changed as you went up, and we tried that. This was
also nitromethane filled.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We seemed to get a
pretty good sample out of it, but the problem we had was that when the
nitromethane went off, razor blade size pieces of steel just spalled off, and
that ended up clogging up our system. So that clearly wouldn't work. Well, we
got to thinking about it, because Mike had had a spectacularly successful connection
to the cavity on Eel.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we started looking
into it, and we ended up going back to the basic viscosity rules and discovered
dilatant fluids. That's something in which the apparent viscosity is
proportional to the rate of shear. To put it in simple terms, if I could fill a
pipe with a fluid so while the shock wave was going through it the fluid had
the viscosity of solid concrete, it would keep the pipe from crushing, and then
as the shock wave went past, the stuff would act like a fluid.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In looking around we realized
that ordinary starch and water would do this. And we added a gel to it. So, we
did some tests and it all looked good in the laboratory. I remember one
spectacular experiment I did. We had a beaker sitting on the table, and I said,
"Okay, if this is really working, what I am supposed to be able to do is
stick a spatula in it, and if I lift it rapidly, it will set up and I'll be
able to lift the whole beaker up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Be sure you don't stop lifting.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heckman</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, that was the problem. You
can only lift to as long as your arm is, and that could be right over your
head. However, that demonstration, as far as I was concerned, was a very practical
one.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I recall you and Heusinkveld
had a sampling pipe on Des Moines. What clever scheme did you use there to
breach the stemming?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heckman</span></b><span class="calibre10">: On Des Moines we built a
section of two-foot diameter pipe, and what we did is we packed it with
polyethylene tubes, polyethylene pipe, and ran it through the stemming. Mike put
a slifer cable right next to our inlet section, and he put a slifer cable over
along the tunnel wall, and then, of course, that part of the tunnel was all
packed with sandbags. Well, as you remember, Des Moines was one of the more
spectacular containment failures.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When you designed this
horizontal pipe for your inlet experiment, and stuffed it with the polyethylene
tubes which would vaporize and explode and keep the pipe open, what was going to
close it? If you had deliberately prevented the ground shock from closing it, what
was going to close it?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heckman</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, Mike didn't really think
that one completely through, and it never occurred to me to worry about it,
because we had that big gas-tight door, right? You were going to get a little activity
out, sure. Remember, this was all kind of back-of-the envelope, and so you
didn't really think about what kind of pulse that was going to be put out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, when we looked at
the signals from the slifers, the slifer he put by the tunnel we never did get
a signal out of. The one on the pipe just took off, and clearly was moving at
about two to three times the free field velocity. When you tried to look at the
signal that was coming off of the slifer on the side of the tunnel, comparing that
with the free field slifers that they had installed in other locations, it was
just very clear that the shock wave coming out of our pipe was just blowing it
up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It became also very
obvious at this point that you don't get just a little bit of the dragon's
breath. Once you connect with the dragon, he keeps blowing. So, as you
remember, the blast door that was sealing the tunnel came flying out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>:
Richard, everything came flying out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Heckman</b>: Yes. And
it's just very clear that Mike Heusinkveld and I were responsible for the Des
Moines fiasco.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Well,
you can't really claim all the credit. There was a vertical rad chem sampling
hole that looked from the top of the mesa down to the device, and pictures from
the fast cameras show that vented immediately, in less than a millisecond. I do
believe that your attempt to keep the pipe in the tunnel open succeeded, and
led to the venting out the portal. But even if that hadn't happened, Des Moines
would have had a big release due to that vertical sampling pipe. So, maybe we
should give Des Moines to the chemists in general, rather than to you in
particular.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
following pictures of the Des Moines venting, on June 13, 1962, were taken by
the author with a hand-held camera. The pictures were taken at irregular time
intervals; the elapsed time between the first and last is probably about ten
minutes. The total release is recorded as 11,000,000 curies, which is one of
the largest releases from any underground event. Regardless of what definition is
chosen, Des Moines was not successfully contained. It is instructive to observe
the amount of material ejected from the tunnel by the energy release from what
was a rather low yield device.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
the pictures there are three distinct venting paths that can be seen, The first
is from the rad chem sampling hole that led to the mesa top. As was mentioned
above, material was released there within the first millisecond. The second
release occurred through a hole that ran from the the face of the mesa down to
the tunnel, and can be seen as a plume that appears before the venting from the
portal develops. The purpose of this hole was basically to protect the
diagnostic film in the trailers near the portal. The thought was that if there
was venting into the tunnel, the pressure would be relieved by having an open
hole from the tunnel to the mesa face. Hopefully, such pressure relief would
allow the door near the portal to remain intact, and so prevent radioactive
material from blackening the diagnostic films in the trailers near the portal.
The third, and major release, was from the portal after the gas-seal door had
been forcibly ejected.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
neither the Des Moines venting, nor that of Platte (about 2 megacuries) in
April of 1962, nor that of Eel (about 2 megacuries) in May of 1962, caused
significant problems to the overall test program. They were significant
problems to the people at Livermore, particularly the people trying to collect
data on film, but there was no stoppage of testing while the causes of the
ventings were explored, there were no changes in field procedures, and so on. Des
Moines was detonated on June l3, 1962, and the Dominic operation was actively
being carried out in the Christmas Island area. In the week preceding and the
week following Des Moines, there were a total of seven airdrops of devices of
intermediate or low megaton yield. If 10 megacuries is taken as the H+ 12 hour
activity from I kiloton of fission, the Des Moines release was about that of a
1 kiloton atmospheric shot. That was trivial compared to the activity being released
in the Pacific, and perhaps that influenced the AEC. On the other hand, it was
close to home, and the people whose data were lost were not happy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
all, Livermore fired seven tunnel events after the resumption of testing in 1961,
and only one, the Madison event, was contained. The last Livermore tunnel event
was Yuba, fired on June 15, 1963. It was not contained and released material
that was detected off the Test Site.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
was in 1963 that the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, widely known as the Limited Test
Ban Treaty, or the Partial Test Ban Treaty was signed. As observed in the first
chapter, the Treaty did not say any event had to be designed to contain all the
radioactive products that were produced - only that the radioactive debris
should not cross the border of, in this case, the United States. For example,
nuclear cratering experiments continued until December 8, 1968, when the 30 kt
cratering event Schooner was fired, presumably under meteorological conditions
that would retain the vented activity with the boundaries of the United States
for some indeterminate time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Containment
failures, as defined today, occurred both before and after the Treaty was
signed. Most of them were minor seepages, but some were major failures,
particularly for the experimenters trying to collect information from the
detonation. There were a variety of reasons for the ventings, and it was not
always easy to determine the cause of those failures.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There was Bandicoot, in 1962,
in about the first year. There was nothing wrong with the containment design, nothing
wrong with the emplacement, or anything like that. I think that was all done
right. We had everything placed assuming the yield we were told it would go
would in fact be the yield. The hole was deep enough for that yield, but I
believe there's no doubt it went well above that. We had enough hydrodynamic
data that we were convinced of that. And so, the hole was just too shallow, and
it vented. It was just that there was this enormously surprising yield. Now,
why was the Bandicoot yield so surprising? Well, it was a type of device where
nobody can estimate yield very well. Of course, what we should have done was
put it much deeper, just to be conservative. But, you see, we took the
designers word for it; what</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">the yield would be, and what the
max cred was.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That as one of the few
times when the yield was, in effect, dictated by a committee, which paid little
attention to data that didn't fit the desired results. It was designed to be so
many kilotons, so that is what it was. And it wasn't. It just wasn't .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I have noticed, at the CEP
meetings, that you are often skeptical of numbers we get from the designers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You've noticed that?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I have noticed that. Perhaps
that's because of your experiences with Bandicoot and Pike.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It's more than that. We've had
a number of times where I have seen idiocies promulgated as fact. And it's done
for political reasons. You understand how that goes; we have promised the Navy,
or the Army that this thing is going to be so many kilotons. And, that's what
they are going to get. Never mind what the yield really looks like.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, Bob, you must realize
that having promised a particular yield, over the course of this many year development
through the Phase 3 and into the stockpile, there has been lots and lots of
money and time spent on targeting plans, training manuals, and so forth, all
based on that yield. Now, you're not going to come in at some late date and
tell them the yield isn't what you promised them, are you?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes, if it is different. I do
understand the cycle you've described, but I do believe that the quicker the
country finds out that something is different from what they thought it was,
the better off the country is.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was bitter about
Bandicoot. I had done what I had been told to do, which was to contain this
shot where the yield was going to be thus and so, and that's it. After the fact
they insisted that's what it was, and it was just a lie. I had my own
hydrodynamic yield measurements, and those measurements gave a much different number,
and I have no reason to take them back today; they were good measurements. Now,
we have relooked at Bandicoot. We went back and drilled for more samples. This
was during Eric Jones' stay. Eric reviewed all my data, and when he got all
through he said, “The hydrodynamic data are correct." By this time we had
gotten rid of the guy who was the problem, and so we got them to concede that
the yield really was a lot higher than it was originally reported.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In early 1963 an
informal meeting was held between Los Alamos and Livermore test principals to
evaluate individual tests. The intention was to share procedures, plans, and
lessons learned, but containment was not a major part of the discussions. After
the Limited Test Ban Treaty was ratified in October in October, 1963, the Eagle
event vented. Considered as a probable violation of the treaty, the event
triggered additional discussions on containment at various levels in the
Laboratories, and in the AEC. From these, the Test Evaluation Panel was
formally established in December.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Panel consisted of
consultants, and persons furnished by LASL, LRL, Sandia, DOD, the Public Health
Service, and the AEC. The USGS furnished the geologic information. The purpose
of the Panel was to "review all data pertinent to the containment aspects of
each planned nuclear test; then, based on these data, to assign the test to one
of the risk categories defined below."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The TEP had three categories,
much as the CEP does, but there the similarity ends. The TEP Category A, in
1966, was "Underground nuclear tests which, on the basis of experience,
should not release a significant amount of radioactive material. It must be understood
that, even in this category, unforeseen conditions may develop which result in
the release of detectable levels of radioactivity at the border." The NYO
Planning Directive for 1964 said, "The emplacement and firing of devices
will be designed to </span><span class="calibre10">result
</span><span class="calibre10">in containment in all
cases where this requirement is not inconsistent with the technical
objectives."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cliff
Olsen, long time Livermore containment scientist, made these comments about the
TEP:</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><i class="calibre13"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olsen</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The people who tended to be at
the TEP meetings were the Test Group Directors, and they presented the shots.
The presentations were very rudimentary. There was a data sheet, and maybe a
line-of-sight pipe layout, or a stemming drawing. Often there was no stemming
drawing, because we had generic stemming plans. There was LASL 5, or LASL 2 at
that time. We would have our stemming plan, which was pea gravel with fifty
feet of sand halfway up, and fifty feet of sand at the surface, and that was
our stemming plan. So, there was no need for a drawing, because they were all
the same. The TEP got into reviewing the designs of particular features a lot
more than the CEP does. In a sense, they would suggest changes, and they would
actually review mechanical designs - why don't you do this, why don't you do
that. And design changes to the hardware were made as a result of the TEP.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="calibre10">One of the things with the TEP,
which I guess was sort of indicative of the climate at the time, was there were
three categories, A, B, C, and C was, "Underground nuclear tests which are
expected to release a significant amount of radioactive material." There
was no particular onus to getting a C. It simply meant that you made different
notifications before you shot it. It had nothing to do with whether you were
going to execute the event. It wasn't that somebody in Washington or Germantown
was going to have a hemorrhage when he saw it. It was just the design of the
event.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One venting in
particular, from the Pike event, fired March 13, 1964, has had a major and
continuing impact on the Test Program. The fallout projections for following
events have been based on the "Pike Model," which means that the
possible fallout from the proposed shot is scaled to the readings that were
obtained in the Pike fallout pattern according to the yield ratio of the two
events. The basic assumption is that the proposed shot will release the same fraction
of the activity that Pike did.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Pike has cost all of us
enormous amounts of time, and effort, and money, and I think needlessly. That
is a thing I have never been able to communicate to NVO in modern times. You
see, one of the things everybody forgets is that we had a line-of-sight pipe on
Pike. It didn't come to the surface, so people forget that it was there. And,
since it didn't come to the surface, although it went a substantial distance,
it had no closures or anything. That pipe was one of the key factors. Another
was that Pike was expected to have a maximum credible yield of a certain value
- not very large, but definitely not a safety shot. Well, it went over one and half
times the max credo And then, it was in a very shallow hole; 400 feet or so.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I knew about it was
that it had this predicted max cred, and the pipe was so long and so big. I
said, "A lot of energy is going to come to the top of that pipe." I did
not realize that there was any chance that the yield could go higher than what
I was told, or I would have hollered. I knew that it was in a shallow hole, so
that bothered me as it was. Another thing I did not know was that when they
drilled that hole they had run into what I called hourglass sand. And guess where
that layer of sand was - which I found out after the shot. It was right at the
top of that pipe.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, there's no chance
in the world we will ever duplicate Pike. First of all, we won't shoot anything
at 400 feet. Secondly, we won't have a pipe on it like that. Thirdly, in a
medium where the sand was running like water - we'll never do that. And
finally, having a max cred yield as bad as that is kind of unthinkable. I say, "Kind
of unthinkable.” When you combine all those things, Pike was a lead-pipe cinch
to be spectacular.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My argument is that to
treat every shot like Pike is absurd. It's just absurd. There isn't anything
that's going to vent like Pike, because we don't do those things anymore. We
will never duplicate Pike, and yet we pretend to the world, and to society, and
to the President of the United States, that this shot we're considering could
come out like Pike did. We don't intend to communicate that message, but that's
what we do, and it's just not true. It's not going to come out like Pike,
because Pike had too many great oddities.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pike is what really
brought us to every detail going through the hands of the containment people.
We said, "No more are we going to take anybody's word for anything.” The
Pike experience was profound for us, because that's when we realized that no
one person was knowledgeable about everything on a shot. I was responsible for certain
things, but not everything. After Pike we began to function in what I'll say is
a modern way. We had a meeting in which the bomb designer had to come and swear
he knew what the yield &nbsp;would be. That really came as a result of Pike. Before,
it was by chance. You knew what you knew by who you happened to talk to, but if
people were on vacation, or you were on vacation, you didn't talk to them, and
you didn't know whatever it was they could have told you. I learned a bitter
lesson on Pike, which was that I thought I knew what the shot was and I didn't.
I didn't know the yield, I didn't know the geologic setting, and I didn't know
about the sand. All these things came out in the wash.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob
Bass, Sandia, Albuquerque, was doing instrumentation work on the hydrodynamic
yield measurements that Los Alamos was doing at that time. He also had
information that Brownlee didn't have.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bass</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Pike could have been foretold.
I was on the instrumentation crew. We were doing hydrodynamic yield
measurements on Pike, and we had three satellite holes. Our job was to
instrument these satellite holes. We had a guy named Jim Greenwald, and he liked
to play with TV. He was our installation engineer when we were lowering these
slifers and/or time of arrival gauges down these holes. Pike, of course, wasn't
very deep. Well, Jim called me and said, "You've never seen such a mess in
your entire life. I lower my TV camera down there, and it's a cavern. I've got
communication between every one of my satellite holes, all the way down. I go a
hundred feet down and there's no sand pile down there. There's nothing but a
labyrinth of tunnels."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we tried to put in
enough stemming to fill up that cavern, but we didn't get it done. We flat
didn't get it done. We got it done for a while, but then it would start again.
We knew that site was Swiss cheese. That shot was sitting there waiting to
vent.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The first political fallout was
about the fallout. It was on Las Vegas, and it also went straight toward Mexico
City. I think somebody in the embassy read something and didn't know what he read,
and it never really did get reported in a sensible way. I don't believe you'll
find any record of a measurement having been made in Mexico City, but I believe
there was.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Al Graves had a
meeting, and I went, and Westerfelt, and for the first time we put together all
the things that were wrong. And I was appalled. So we, at the second level,
bared our breasts and said, “Well, we had done this, and we had not done that,
and the yield was quite a bit higher than we were expecting, etc." Then Washington
came down hard on us on all those points, but they knew these things because we
told them about them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing they knew was
that it had crossed the border. We made lots of promises of brand new
procedures, which indeed we did initiate. And we really changed our working
relationships after Pike, between the people at the Laboratory, and the people
in the field doing the engineering and drilling. I remember that as being profound.
We said, "This will never happen again."</span></p>

<h2>Chapter 4: The Beginnings of Containment Programs</h2>
<br>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As time went by, the tolerance of releases of radioactivity from the underground
detonations at the NTS diminished until it became obvious to the Laboratories
and the DNA that serious effort must be given to all the questions that such
releases raised. And the list of questions was daunting. What was it that
prevented such enormous energy releases from rupturing the ground and thereby
releasing the gases, steam, and radioactivity to the atmosphere? Obviously it
was related to the amount of material over the detonation. In what way did the
necessary amount of material depend on what the material was? How was it
related to the chemical composition of the material, the strength of the
material, which in turn is related to the amount of water in the material? How
does the material react to pressures of millions of atmospheres, and to
temperatures of many tens of thousands of degrees? Does it matter if the
material is fractured or faulted, and if does, how? What pressures and
temperatures actually are created in the material, and how do they decay with time?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
original thoughts about doing experiments underground arose from pressures to
reduce off-site fallout, and desires to make the operations easier to carry
out. Contamination of the shot sites, and radiation exposures to people working
in the field gave additional incentives to the Laboratories to find different
ways to conduct the tests. In a similar way, the releases that occurred on some
of the underground shots were a problem to those trying to collect experimental
data. At first, political pressures to achieve better containment were minimal,
but by the time of Baneberry in 1970 they became controlling.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olsen</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It must have been late' 65 that
I started to do things in containment. There had been several leaks, but the
political climate of the time was sort of, "So what?" But the Test
Program people really didn't like getting trailer parks exposed, because virtually
all the shot data was on film, which turned black if it got irradiated, and
there went the data. If you put the trailer park upwind, nobody really cared if
you leaked a little bit. But the AEC people eventually began to think that we
ought to be a little more careful. The straw that broke the camel's back was a
thing called Diluted Waters, which was shot in Frenchman Flat in June of '65.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember I was working
on something in Yucca at the time. I was driving over the old Burma Road, and
heard the countdown for Diluted Waters on the net, so I parked the car and
watched it. At zero time there was a little dust, and a few seconds later a big
cloud came out. A few other cars had stopped, and the guys watched for a while,
and then we decided, “Oh well, another one," and we started our cars and
went out to Yucca Flat.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I got back to Livermore,
my division leader, Jim Carothers, called me into his office, and asked me if I
would be interested in something called containment. It seemed the AEC had
gotten a little worried that we were having some problems, and Diluted Waters
had kind of sensitized enough people that the AEC was going to form an
investigating committee to look into it, because we had guaranteed we had
solved the problems. We were involved even though it was a DASA shot. Now, we
thought we had solved some of the line-of-sight problems on earlier things,
going back to Eagle, in '63.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Mr. Olsen, since Eagle released
enough energy to create an explosion at the surface which completely destroyed
the surface structure and the experiments thereon, I cannot say that I would
use Eagle as an example of how you had solved things.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olsen</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, no, but it led us to
things that needed solving, let us say.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span class="calibre10">So, in '65 this Jim Carothers
asked me to look into containment, and it turned out at that time it had to do
primarily with line-of-sight shots and the diagnostics thereof. So, we went
scrounging for recording equipment for slow diagnostics, as compared to
reaction history. We were looking at tens of microseconds, and millisecond response
rather than nanosecond things. We got help from EG&amp;G, primarily Santa
Barbara. And some from EG&amp;G Albuquerque, which at that time existed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were looking
basically at flow in the pipe itself; time of arrival, pressures, as well as
radiation coming up the stemming and the pipe itself. We were looking at how
you could attenuate flow in a pipe. I f you want to do that you obviously have
to look at what's going on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: How
did you do that? Pipe flow is still an interesting, difficult problem.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Olsen</b>: That is
true. We tried lots of things, some of which worked, and some of which didn't.
We used ordinary pin switches, and pressure pins. We used pressure transducers.
We used optical time of arrival things, slifer cables both inside and outside
the pipe. We used radiation detectors.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: And lo
and behold, you discovered that indeed there was a lot of pipe flow, and it
often came right out the top of the pipe.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Olsen</b>: That's
right. And it got to where we were measuring differential pressures, we hoped,
across closure mechanisms. If you saw zero above, and a lot below, it said that
thing really closed, and really worked. These were man-made closures, as
opposed to ground shock driven. There were high explosive driven, and mechanically
driven, closures. And there were lots of varieties of those. There were ball
valves, and flapper valves, and so on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Did
any of them work?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Olsen</b>: Yes, some
of them did, although some of them didn't. In fact, some of them were probably
worse than if they hadn't been there. Probably the worst one we put in was a
thing called HE flaps. They were dimples that had been cut in the pipe at
alternating spots. You put little pads of HE on them, and shoved pieces of the
pipe in, rather than trying to close it symmetrically. The idea was to obscure the
pipe by pushing things in. One version of these flaps was to cut the pipe at
the bottom of the flap, and shove this flap in so that something coming up the
pipe would come to the area of the pipe where this piece had been pushed
across, and the flow would then just go out into the stemming.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Say,
that sounds clever.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Olsen</b>: That was
really clever. Unfortunately, this thing weakened the pipe so much that what it
did was put a tab of material out in the flow, and that tab could rip off very
easily. So, the whole thing went right on up the pipe.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span class="calibre10">We had a few other disasters on
line-of-sight pipes. Some, like Tapestry, weren't too bad. The reason it leaked
was that some valves at surface ground zero jammed a bit and didn't close all
the way.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Did
you ever have a successfully contained pipe shot?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Olsen</b>: Oh yes.
Probably the best ones were Crew and Flax. They were unusual in that the pipe
terminated underground, and we had the things there that we wanted to expose
and follow for a time. Obviously you had to close the pipe, or there wouldn't
be anything there to look at. Both of those events were quite successful. Packard
was another one where we had exposure stations about halfway down the pipe, and
we wanted to pull them up the pipe to recover them. That was quite successful.
We closed everything off below the exposure stations.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By then we knew about
things that didn't work, like the HE flaps that just put more mass into the
flow. We knew not to put an HE closure, even though the closure worked, in too
close, because the ground shock could simply go around it, as if it weren't
even there, and still have enough energy to pour energy into the line-of-sight pipe.
So, you have to put even a fast HE closure far enough out so the ground shock
doesn't just envelop it and keep going. We learned that closer isn't
necessarily better. We learned how to build valves that would seat in the
environment. We learned how to decouple them, if necessary, with joints and
things like that, to modify the environment so they would survive.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a better
capability, by then, to look at the energy in the front end, and to look at
things where we could limit the energy going in. Often, in the early shots the
experimenters wanted everything they could get. So, they wanted bigger and
bigger apertures.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: That's
still true. The experimenters always want more than they can have.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Olsen</b>: That
wasn't always true though. On Flax, for example, we put a segment of a pie-type
collimator in the front of the pipe to cut down on the flux. That, of course,
made it easier to close, because part of the path was already plugged. When the
experimenters got to be a little less grabby about wanting everything it sometimes
made things easier. But a lot of it was trial and error.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Livermore Hupmobile
event, fired on January 18, 1968, released activity that resulted in a major
loss of data, and radioactivity was detected off-site. It did not result in the
kind of long-lasting operational changes that Pike did, but it did lead to the formation
of a separate group, responsible for the design of the containment plan, at
Livermore. Cliff Olsen and Billy Hudson became two of the first members of that
group.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Olsen</b>: In those
days I think ninety percent of the reason for expending effort on containment
related to data loss, rather than pressure from Washington. That begin to
change probably around '67 to '68. It may have been as a result of Hupmobile,
because the people in Washington who supplied the money, even though they were
not so worried about the loss of data as the experimenters, got antsy about
dumping money into these things and not getting anything in return. Hupmobile
was quite expensive for the time. I think that may have been the first thing
beyond strictly experimenters wondering why their film was black.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hudson</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Hupmobile turned out to be a
containment fiasco, in that a lot of the film data was lost due to the
radiation release. The decision was made at the Associate Director level to
form a containment group, and to try to put some serious effort into understanding
containment and saving the film. Jim Carothers asked me to join that group, and
it appeared to me to be an offer I couldn't refuse.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe it was in late
1968 that happened. For about the first two years Bill McMaster and I used to
have some words now and then about how this surely wouldn't be more than a two
year problem, and then we could get back to doing some science. "We'll figure
this out, won't take more than two years, then we'll get back to interesting
physics." Fortunately, it got more and more interesting, because it turned
out to be much more than a two year problem.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: I'm
surprised that the containment group came along so late, because there were a
number of Livermore events earlier that had been, by today's standards, quite
catastrophic containment failures.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Hudson</b>:
Personally, it was my impression that we became interested in having a
containment group because so much data was being lost on experiments like
Hupmobile. On the earlier events there weren't that many experiments, so it was
a relatively small loss, even though they perhaps lost a major fraction of what
they had on the event. It was a small loss compared to the loss on Hupmobile. And,
programmatic people decided that since this was the direction they wanted to
go, bigger and more comprehensive experiments, something had to be done about
containment so they would have some confidence that after spending all that
money on the test they would get the data back. The primary problem then was to
protect the film so the prompt diagnostics folks could go back to the Laboratory,
read the film, and tell the bomb designers what they did right or what they did
wrong. It was not to protect the environment; it was to protect the data.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Partial Test Ban
Treaty had been signed in 1963, several years earlier. The Treaty said we were
not to do any experiments where radioactive material would go beyond the
national boundaries of the U.S. That was a primary guideline; no radiation
across our international borders. But in fact, measures had already been taken
to pretty much limit the escape across the border. Just by the act of putting a
few hundred feet of dirt over the device you almost always eliminated radiation
getting to the border. There were a few events after the early sixties that
released material that may have gone across the border, but they were very few.
It was mostly a local problem, because the radiation leakage would be confined
almost to the site of the event itself, or maybe a little larger. But, it was
that local radiation that was causing the damage to the film containing the
data, and that was the kind of problem most often encountered.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we had a release that
got up to the neighborhood of ten thousand curies there was a possibility of
activity getting off site. Less than a thousand curies was of little or no
concern to the general public, or the people in Washington. However, it was of
great concern to the people whose film was in the recording trailers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the late 1960's,
early 1970's, they were doing some exposure experiments, with an open
line-of-sight pipe to the surface. It took a few tries before the hardware was
properly designed to stop the rush of hot gases and refractory products to the surface,
but that problem was pretty well solved by the time the containment group was
formed. I don't think people realized it, but we didn't see much more of the
Hupmobile type releases on our line-of-sight shots after we formed the
containment group.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Baneberry event, detonated on December 18, 1970 with a yield of 10 kilotons,
was the watershed in the history of containment. It was fired in an emplacement
hole in Area 8, and had a vertical, non-divergent line-of-sight pipe. It vented
spectacularly through a fissure, a little over three minutes after the device
was fired. The cloud of dust and debris rose some 12,000 feet, and was reported
to have been seen by people at the NVO offices in Las Vegas. The total release
is today given as 6,900,000 curies (H+ 12 hours). Interestingly, almost all of
the activity was the volatile and gaseous elements, so there was little fallout
deposition from Baneberry. The integrated total activity in the fallout
pattern, on the ground, was a small fraction of that in the Pike pattern.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
wind patterns before the shot indicated the transport of any effluent to the
northeast, and so the Area 12 camp, to the west of the shot site, had not been
cleared of the people staying there. However, surface winds carried some of the
activity to the west. During the time it took to alert the people in the camp,
and to clear the area, a number of people received radiation exposures, and
some of those filed lawsuits in the following years, alleging damage to their
health and longevity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
AEC allowed no more detonations for some six months while a committee, called
the Vinceguerra Committee, after the Chairman, examined the causes of the
venting, and the method of operations at the Test Site. In the report of the
committee several recommendations were made for changes in the way future test operations
should be carried out, and how improvements could be made in the way the
containment aspects of an event were evaluated. One of the recommendations was
that the Test Evaluation Panel should be reconstituted, and a new Charter
developed for the new Panel. The Containment Evaluation Panel, as the new Panel
was called, consisted of a Chairman, one member and an alternate nominated by
each of LASL, LRL, Sandia, DNA, USGS, and the Desert Research Institute. In
addition, provision was made for the Manager, NVO, to appoint one or more
consultants. Members nominated by particular organizations, or consultants
recommended by the Chairman, were formally appointed by the Manager, NVO, to serve
on what was an advisory Panel to him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter
Broyles, Sandia, was one of the first members of the CEP.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Broyles</b>: I think
the members of the Panel all recognized there was a political need to be met,
to prove to the nation that we were paying attention. And clearly it was
evident in the series of proposed charters, and hassling that went on between
Nevada and the Labs and Washington on just what the charter should say. I think
I viewed from the very beginning that the CEP took it's role as a technical
judgment body seriously, and more than just political window dressing.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I think some
members perhaps were over-enthralled. Not so much over-zealous, but perhaps
they did not have a full appreciation of the limits of our technical knowledge,
and therefore tended to give themselves more credit for how sure they were of
any technical facts than we really were. They didn't necessarily recognize the
technical limitations, and the lack of knowledge of geophysics and
geo-engineering, and what the characteristics of the real world were, how
variable they were, and the limitations of the calculations.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly various parts of
the structure looked different from different perspectives, and the CEP, I
think, was many different things to many different people. But the Panel
itself, from the very beginning took its role seriously, and took it as a
technical challenge to do the best job they could, because it was obvious that
the world was going to be different after Baneberry.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Livermore
containment group had been in existence for some two years when the Baneberry
venting occurred. During those years they were supported as part of the overall
testing effort, but their authority to affect a particular shot was
questionable. That changed significantly after Baneberry.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Hudson</b>: Following
Baneberry the Test Program was shut down for six months, and the people who
designed bombs and wanted to get data back were suddenly aware that containment
was a very important factor to be considered. It was the beginning of a movement
directed toward the idea that we shouldn't have anything out at all. If it was
above background, it was too much. It was clear that was where people were
headed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were about a dozen
people in the containment group </span><span class="calibre10">at
</span><span class="calibre10">that time, as I
recall, and I would guess that two-thirds of them were involved with
calculations. This is when the major effort was directed at adapting the codes
that first had been used for bombs, later to describe what's going on in the
pipe, to describing what's going on in the earth. It was clear that the interaction
between the bomb and the ground might be the ultimate worry, not just the interaction
between the bomb and the pipe.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>:
Clearly demonstrated by the Baneberry venting. Why didn't the containment group
prevent that?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Hudson</b>: Well,
that is an interesting question. At that time the containment program was
really under the umbrella of the Test Director and the operational folks. We
didn't have a Containment Evaluation Panel. In those days we had the Test
Evaluation Panel, and the Test Evaluation Panel was more concerned with having
a successful experiment than they were with containment. As a result, when
containment aspects of an event were considered, they were presented by the operational
side of the program.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We in the containment
group were operating in a support mode. If they wanted to pay attention to us
they did. If they thought that the concerns we had wouldn't lead to an
expensive loss of data, then they didn't. The objective was still to bring back
the data. And as a matter of fact, they brought back data on Baneberry.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we did say was that
we should run some logs in that hole, and find out what kind of densities and
velocities we really were shooting in. We did ask for them, but we didn't get
them, because we couldn't make a good enough case for it. We couldn't say,
"Hey, if the velocity is below this, or the density is below this or above
that, we're going to have a release problem, or a vent." We just knew there
were questions we would like to have had answered before the event. We knew
there were some things that were new and different, and that we didn't
understand.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we could have said,
"Hey, you're going to lose a lot of data," then we would have gotten
their attention. But as far as containment per se is concerned, we didn't have
a lot of leverage. And, we didn't know we were going to have a horrific containment
problem. We just knew that there were some things about the site that were unusual,
and that was our cause for worry. But we didn't have any theory as to why we
were worried. We were just worried because it was new and different. Without
having a really logical, well thought out reason for delaying things, it was
hard to give credence to our fears.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: You
might contrast that with today, almost twenty-five years later. Today if the
containment group said, "We have fears and we don't know the
answers," you would be listened to more, I believe.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Hudson</b>: I think
there's no doubt about it. The attitude today is that we have to demonstrate
why somebody's fears aren't really a problem. In those days somebody had to
demonstrate why a fear was a problem. Today we're almost in the position of
having to prove negatives. Just the opposite was true in the past. Then we had
to prove that there was a problem. Today we have to demonstrate that there's
not a problem - as well as we can.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognizing the changes
that were taking place, and the strong requirements that were being developed
for complete containment, Los Alamos organized a formal containment group in
1970. Bob Brownlee had been working on the containment of underground events
since 1956. In 1966 he was joined by Carl Keller, and they did a number of
calculations and experiments related to line-of-sight shots, but it was not
until after Baneberry that a containment group, per se, was formed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: When
did there get to be somebody working on containment besides you, or when did
there get to be a defined containment activity?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Brownlee</b>: It was
at Baneberry time that we actually formed a containment group, and I became the
group leader. We finally decided that between Baneberry and when we started
testing again. The first step in that direction was actually back in 1966, when
Ogle said, "Get somebody and teach them." So, I hired Carl Keller. He
was young then. I'm the same age now as then, but he's older for some reason. I
hired Carl, and just spent time with him. We started going through things, and
learning, and doing things, and I started transferring jobs to him. Before that
some people were named as doing containment. That is, there was somebody in
J-6, and there was somebody somewhere else, there was me and Carl. These people
stayed in their own organizations, but they were supposed to work on
containment. In effect we had a very small containment group scattered around
the Lab.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: When
you say, "formed a containment group," does that mean these people
now physically came to work in one area?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Brownlee</b>: Yes.
J-9 was formed at that time. Jack House was in J-8. He had a little training in
geology, so I latched on to Jack right away, and got Jack into the group. Then,
after we had that group, I hired Fred App. I started hiring people for the
purpose of containment. Bob Sharp and Tom Weaver were both in J-9, the containment
group. And so we had some pretty good guys, and for the first time we had some
geologists.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span class="calibre10">So, the containment effort, as
you see it now, is really derived from that containment group, J-9. That's when
we started down that path.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">House</b>: I had
never actually heard anything about containment until that December morning in
1970 when Baneberry vented. I happened to be in Mercury in the J-3 operations
group office, waiting to ride into town with Bob Newman, who was then one of our
Test Directors, to get a plane back to Los Alamos. There was this ominous gray
cloud rising up over the Gate 200 pass. I didn't know what it was, but Newman
proceeded to tell me that LRL had a really bad leak. We could see the cloud all
the way into town. I happened to be sitting on the left side of the aircraft as
we flew towards Albuquerque, and I could still see that cloud when we were clear
out over the Grand Canyon, until the sight angle became diminished to the point
where you could no longer see it. That was my first introduction to
containment.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About two months later I
got a call from Ogle saying that I was being temporarily reassigned to a new
group that was being formed under Bob Brownlee. It was to be a containment
group called J-9. Apparently Ogle told Brownlee that he had to form up a
purpose-oriented containment group, and he could pick any of the J group numbers
not in use, and Bob picked J-9.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people who were in
J-9 were Brownlee, Bob Sharp, Carl Keller, and a few other folks, probably less
than ten, that Brownlee had assembled from other groups in the Laboratory. So
we had this little cadre of dedicated personnel who were to do “containment,"
whatever that was. I didn't know anything about containment except probably how
to spell it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, in early
1971, we were in the six months test moratorium mandated by the Atomic Energy
Commission post Baneberry. Now we were supposed to have information, geological
information, about the shot sites. All the emplacement holes that Los Alamos
had in inventory were cased. How can we do site characterization and examine
the material properties in a cased hole? So, we initiated a drilling program
for exploratory holes, in close proximity to the emplacement holes, that could
be sampled and logged.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We initiated our program
of exploratory drilling, and sampling, and so forth. Because we didn't have the
necessary expertise to do the geologic analysis, the data went to the USGS at
Denver, where Evan Jenkins and Paul Orkild and their people did the analysis.
The USGS would then put together a site characterization package - the cross
sections and the whole nine yards. Livermore at that time was able to do those
kinds of things in-house, because they had the necessary personnel. Billy
Hudson and Cliff Olsen had been doing containment work for a few years, and they
were our distant colleagues in this new, for me, world.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a real circus in
those early days of 1971 while we were still learning the containment business.
We didn't have any designated presenter for the events that came before the new
Containment Evaluation Panel, as Livermore did. As I recall, Billy Hudson was
the designated presenter. And we had no containment scientists as we know
today, or event managers, as some people call them when they're trying to
figure out what a containment scientist is. Well, how do we do this thing,
which we had never done?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very first event
that was presented by Los Alamos to the CEP was a shot in Area 3. Bob Brownlee
sat at the CEP table and read the prospectus to the Panel. I was sitting in the
audience along with essentially all the rest of J -9, there being only a few of
us, and that's how the presentation was made. The USGS sat in the audience and
responded to whatever geological or geophysical questions were posed by the
Panel. Bill Twenhofel was on the Panel, and he was the USGS representative.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: No.
Bill was on the Panel, but Jack, there aren't representatives of organizations
on the Panel. There are independent experts. They may make their living by
working for some organization, but they don't represent that organization.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">House</b>: Yes. I do
understand that you do work hard to try to maintain that distinction.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyhow, Brownlee soon
became dissatisfied with this mechanism of reading the prospectus to the Panel,
and he concluded that Los Alamos would need a designated presenter. He also
decided that we needed individuals who would be assigned to prepare the prospectus.
They were to pull everything together from all the different venues, like the
engineering folks who were doing the diagnostics rack design, and the
operations folks who were drilling the holes, and backfilling them, and so
forth. Carl Keller had been writing the prospectuses. Then one day Brownlee
came to myself and Roy Saunders, and said, "Okay, we have a couple of
these one-point safety tests, and they're in these little shallow holes, and they're
not very complicated. Roy, you write one up, and Jack, you do the other
one." And so we did.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl made the
presentations for a while. Then, I guess he decided that really wasn't his cup
of tea. So Brownlee called me one evening at home, and dropped this little
nugget in my lap, saying that I was going to start presenting all the events. I
was not real comfortable with that. Bob prevailed, as Bob always has, at least
in my case, and 10 and behold, not too terribly long thereafter I was standing
at the podium presenting an event to the CEP. Lacking any experience, I mimicked
Billy Hudson in my presentation. As time evolved, the containment prospectus
preparation and presentation became my task, with a lot of support from my
colleagues.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We continued on with the
USGS supplying our geologic packages until about 1974 or 1975, somewhere along
in there. That relationship was not always comfortable for the USGS people up
in Denver, because we didn't know, in the early days, what we really wanted or
needed. So, those guys didn't know quite how to respond to our needs. As a
result, we had some interesting meetings, hosted by the Lawrence Radiation Lab,
about things like grain density - what did we need to measure in grain
densities, and how should we do it? Should we use the air pycnometer, or should
we use this other kind of trap, or what? And what should we expect in alluvium,
and what should we expect in tuff? And how about the lavas in Pahute Mesa? So,
there were problems in determining data needs.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in late 1974 the
USGS made an incredibly gross error in the assessment of a Paleozoic scarp
location near a hole in Area 4. That caused us to have to drill a special
exploratory hole, do sidetracking, and so on. The J Division management,
Brownlee in particular - as an aside, Brownlee had been moved on from being the
J-9 group leader to being an associate or assistant division leader in the J
Division office - decreed that J-9 should hire a geologist, and diminish our
dependency on the USGS.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where were we going to
get a geologist who knew anything about the Test Site? Well, we had Fenix and
Sisson geologists who supported Los Alamos as our “well-sitters." They sat
the emplacement holes, or the exploratory holes, as they were being drilled on
the Test Site. So we thought, “Let’s pick the guy assigned to Los Alamos, and
let's hire that guy. He's got to know something about the geology of our test
holes."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hired a young man
named Mike Ray from F&amp;S. Mike came to work with me, and we then hired a
geophysicist to do well-log analysis on the Birdwell logs supplied to us.
Gradually Los Alamos developed enough of a geoscience capability that we were
able to tell the USGS that we didn't need their geologic packages anymore, because
we were going to do that in-house.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We, I think, separated
ourselves from the USGS without acrimony. I think, quite frankly, the Survey
was relieved to get out of that production mode. That's not their cup of tea.
They are primarily a research organization, and they don't like to be called
and told, “Look, we needed this yesterday. Where is it?" And then to be
called back and told, “Well, we got it, but it's not right. Now you need to do
this, and that." There weren't many of those occasions, but still, that
didn't fit the Survey's view of themselves.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, here we are in the
mid-seventies now, and we have our own geosciences capability. House is making
all the presentations and writing all the documents, and so forth. That went on
until 1979, when we changed Lab Directors. Harold Agnew left the Laboratory, and
Don Kerr, a former J Division staffer from years before, took over as Director.
One of the very first things he did was to dissolve J Division, the field test
organization. He spread out the groups that were in J Division to other
divisions, such as WX, weapons engineering. Then they looked at the containment
group and said, "What shall we do with these guys?" Well, Brownlee
was then the geosciences division leader, and that seemed like the right place
to be. We do geoscience stuff, and Brownlee is known in our Laboratory as the
father of containment at Los Alamos, and so let's put these guys, the J-9 guys,
over there in G Division, and call them G something or other.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've forgotten why they
chose to dissolve J Division. It was much to the dismay of the people in J
Division. We all ended up working for other existing divisions in the
Laboratory. The diagnostic guys were all put in the Physics Division, and they
were called the weapons physics guys. The field engineering and rack design
guys were put in WX, under a management they had not previously been associated
with.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Kunkle</b>: I was
hired by J-9, but when the paperwork was done the group called itself G-6. By
the time I showed up in 1980 it was calling itself G-S. According to rumor that
was because Don Kerr, the then Director, decided to get rid of J Division, the
field testing division, in the fall of 1979 because he was concerned that a comprehensive
test ban would soon be enacted, and a field testing division would be something
easily clipped out of the budget. So he decided to - I wouldn't say hide -
submerge those activities in other divisions. One of the divisions created, an
artificial division, was G, the Geology Division, and Bob Brownlee became the
division leader of that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">House</b>: Actually, J-9,
the containment group, came out best, because we were re-associated with our
former boss, and that worked out reasonably well for us, and for the
containment organization.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were three
supporting groups, discipline oriented. There was geology and geochemistry,
geophysics, and something called geoanalysis, which we just called computer
jocks. So we were in some common organization which has metamorphosed through being
called Geosciences, then Earth and Space Sciences, to now being called Earth
and Environmental Sciences.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Containment
Project Office was created, and I was named as the Deputy Project Leader. In
late 1980 the gentleman who had lasted but eight months as the Principal
Project Leader decided to seek other employment, so he bailed out and went to another
division which had nothing whatsoever to do with containment. As a result of
that Bob Brownlee called me into his office one day and said, "I intend to
make you the Containment Project Manager." I was either too stupid, or too
stunned, to say no, and so that became my task, in addition to making the presentations,
and writing the documents, and all this other large load of responsibilities.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two or three months,
maybe as many as six, I went to Brownlee and said, "I can't do all this.
It's too much." He said, "Well, what do you want to do then? How do
you want to structure this?" I said, "I want to follow Livermore's
model of having containment scientists, or event managers. I want to make a selection
of people, and for openers I'll pick Fred App, who's one of our CEP members,
and Eric Jones, and Nancy Maruzak, and we'll make them into containment
scientists. They will be responsible for the event from the time I assign it to
them, and we layout the parameters for it, with the yield and the location. And
they'll carry it through the presentation, and ultimately the post-shot report,
to the Panel." Brownlee said, "Okay, we'll try it," and so we
did.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's where we are
today. except with far fewer people. At one time in our glorious past, which,
as I recall, was fiscal year 1984, the Containment Program had 34 FTE's, which
represented about 42 to 45 actual personnel. That was pretty big, and it was pretty
much paralleled by our colleagues at Livermore in their containment program.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Brownlee</b>: When
the containment groups were large, and even before, there were a good many
opportunities for Los Alamos and Livermore to work together toward common
goals. There were also many opportunities for disagreements. At any given time,
both kinds of activities were on-going. It was therefore possible to believe
that no cooperation ever occurred, or that good togetherness was possible,
depending upon just where one happened to sit. I happened to have one foot in
each activity, and remember a few occasions when Los Alamos asked certain
questions that caused some difficulty for Livermore in public meetings, yet the
result enhanced certain arguments that Livermore's containment people could not
win at home. So, some debates were based on what I will call a "non-obvious
agenda".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; House</span></b><span class="calibre10">: A sidelight that I would like
to bring to your attention is the incredible acrimony that existed between
Lawrence Livermore guys and Los Alamos containment guys in the early, if not
almost all the way through, the seventies. It seemed to be initially precipitated
by two adversaries across the table, who shall remain nameless, who got into a
shouting match one day at a CEP meeting . I remember it as well as if it were
last week. Those two gentlemen were summarily removed from the Panel by the
Chairman. One of them, by his choice, no longer works at Livermore, and the
other one, by his choice, is retired from Los Alamos. But for a long time there
was an incredible acrimony; there was a real bad - them guys at Livermore, and
vice versa - attitude.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: I know
the two gentlemen to whom you refer. I remember the situation, and I did remove
them from the Panel. I must say I had a little difficulty with Los Alamos. I
talked to Brownlee first, and he was understanding of my position. Then I got a
call from Dr. Charles I. Brown, who informed me that the Los Alamos Scientific
Laboratory would decide who would be their representative on the Panel, and that
was not something that was within my purview. I explained to Dr. Brown that Los
Alamos did not have a representative on the Panel; that was not the way the Panel
was constituted. The Laboratories, and other organizations, nominated people
they felt were reasonably expert in the field, and subject to the Manager's
approval, and mine, those people could serve on the Panel. Anyway, I won.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">House</b>: Yes. I
noticed that you did, and I have remembered that. And, quite frankly, the
tension level was reduced dramatically as a result of that change of personnel.
Anyway, to carry on with this, and not to beat a dead horse, it wasn't until
Larry McKague became Livermore's containment project leader, then succeeded by Frank
Morrison, that we started working together to try to reduce this tension and
acrimony. I remember Carl Smith sitting at the CEP table one day and commenting
about the acrimony that apparently existed between the two Labs. That caused me
to think about how we could defuse this. We were viewing the attitude of our containment
colleagues at Livermore as a "hassle LASL" attitude. I thought that
was no good, and that we ought to do something to fix that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first real case of a
friendly gesture was when the late Frank Morrison invited me out to sit in on a
Livermore pre-CEP meeting. This was absolutely unprecedented! Sit in on a
pre-CEP? That's inviting the enemy into your camp; the fox into the hen house.
But I went, and it was great, although I was a little uncomfortable, needless
to say. Then after the pre-CEP, that evening I was invited to Frank's home, and
he had some of the Livermore containment folks over for dinner. That was what
really broke the ice, I think. After Frank's tragic demise I continued to work
with his successors, up to and including Norm Burkhard, the current program
leader. We have, I think, maintained a much better attitude. We don't hold hands,
per se, but we do talk to each other, and when the Laboratories independently
review each other's containment prospectuses prior to presentation to the CEP
we try to air all our dirty laundry, behind the scenes and before the CEP
meeting, so we don't get in there and have one of these acrimonious activities.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Do you
think that's proper?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">House</b>: The
reviewing of each other’s shots? I think that's a very important part of the
checks and balances that seems to be built into the containment community. And
of course you must understand, it doesn't exist just between the two
Laboratories. We get comments from the USGS, whose primary focus is on the site
characterization package. When Russ Duff, of S-Cubed, was on the Panel, he
would call me up with a concern, and we would discuss it. Sometimes it was a
simple question that needed explaining, and perhaps Russ didn't feel he might
want to raise it in the forum of the CEP, but he really wanted an answer. As
far as the two Laboratories looking over each other’s shoulders, and as one wag
has been known to say, "keeping each other honest," I think it's a
very important part of the way we do business.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been
occasions when either Lab has served notice on the other one's event, via the
prospectus mode and response. "Maybe you guys ought to look at this,"
or "Have you really calculated that, and do you really believe those
numbers?" So I think it's incredibly important, and it's been something
we've continued. The way it works is quite simple. We transmit the prospectus
to the containment community, and of course the other Laboratory is included,
and we expect a response within a week or two. It usually comes as a FAX, and
is prepared by one of the principal containment members of the organization. In
many cases it's the CEP member, like Cliff Olsen at Livermore, or Tom Kunkle at
Los Alamos. And there will be questions and comments on the event. And then we
interact, and it's most helpful.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Then
why do you need a CEP? And I do not mean that as a frivolous question.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">House</b>: No, I
don't take it as such. Why do we need a CEP? The Panel represents a rather
broad scientific experience base. Hydrologists, geologists, radiochemists,
people who are well versed and have expertise in the calculational side of the
house, and people we might refer to as phenomenologists. These folks are
looking at the sponsoring Laboratory's containment plan from, hopefully, an
independent viewpoint. So you have nine or ten individuals reviewing and
discussing and questioning the plan of the sponsoring Laboratory. It provides a
review that is, in my experience, unparalleled for plans of operations that are
going to go forward, especially with something as critical as an underground
nuclear test.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Containment Panel
review has a distinct ES&amp;H aspect to it. Back in the days before Admiral
Watkins we didn't call it ES&amp;H, but it certainly is environment, safety,
and health oriented, and it's a big part of the whole thing. There have been
occasions when the sponsoring Laboratory had an event reviewed by the
Containment Evaluation Panel, and has had to step back and say, "Well,
maybe we didn't do this quite right. Maybe that hole isn't suitable for that event."
And so, appropriate steps and responses are taken. Once again checks and
balances are in play.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: There
are some people who feel that the process has gotten to be pretty cut and
dried, and that it has become a kind of ritualistic process that you have to go
through. And that the CEP doesn't really do much, other than providing a public
facade of reviewing the Laboratories' and DNA's activities.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">House</b>: I think
you would find, if you ask any seasoned member of the containment staff at
either Los Alamos or Livermore, or at the DNA, they would strenuously object to
that. To some it may seem like a rote process, where you go to the Panel, and
you stand up and you present the standard set of viewgraphs, and you make the
standard apple pie and Chevrolet arguments. But the fact remains that you are
having your containment plan reviewed by, not a peer group, but a group of
experts in the field of underground testing. While it may seem like the same old
stuff, every time we go to a Containment Evaluation Panel presentation, granted
it is repetitive, you will find that each containment scientist is extremely sensitized
and concerned about the design they have put together. And not just to get it approved.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: When a
person does a presentation, in front of friends and peers from his or her own
Laboratory, and people from a couple of other, may I say possibly competing
organizations, and from various other places, there are going to be questions
about various aspects of the plan. Basically that person doesn't want to look
stupid. I wouldn't want to stand up there and make a fool of myself.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">House</b>: I know
what you mean. I've been there, Jim. But consider this. Both Laboratory
containment staffs have what we call pre-CEP meetings. Or you could refer to
them as dry runs for the presentation. The way we like to view it is that it's
a heck of a lot easier to take flak here at home, from your peer group, and be prepared,
and be able to answer the majority of questions that presumably might be posed
to you, versus doing it in front of the Panel. I likened the CEP presentation,
to Brownlee, and mind you this was back when I was doing them all, in many
cases one a month, especially during the high yield test series in '76, to be
like defending your doctoral thesis once a month.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a pretty stressful
situation, and sure you don't want to look bad, and sure you'd like to get your
event properly categorized and approved. But by golly, when push comes to shove
and the Panel, as a whole, or as an individual Panel member, finds something
that is unsuitable, whether it isn't understood, or what have you, we better to
step back and take another look rather than try to move forward with something
that might cause a problem at shot time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, you don't want to
present something that might not make it through the detonation authority
process. I can remember one time when the Chairman's recommendation to the
Manager, and the Manager's subsequent forwarding of the detonation authority package
back to Germantown didn't guarantee the event was going to get approved by
Headquarters.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: It has
happened once only that the DOE Headquarters has refused the Manager's request
for detonation authority. That was for the Kawich event, and I consider that to
have been an embarrassing failure on my part. I went to the Manager and apologized
for having put him in that situation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">House</b>: Well, it
is an awful feeling, and as I said, I have been there, to stand up in front of
the Panel and get put on the run. Once I got a post-presentation viewgraph from
my Livermore colleagues about the “wounded rabbit" syndrome. Or, to have
an event come up to categorization and have someone on the Panel give it a dissenting
vote. It stops everything dead in the water.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DNA took a different
route than the Laboratories In approaching the problem of containment. They
were doing both vertical and horizontal line-of-sight shots, with limited
success in containing the radioactive products of the detonation. And, like the
Laboratories, they were losing experimental data. Joe LaComb, DNA, had much of
the responsibility for the way the events were designed and constructed, but he
had no person designated as responsible for containment.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">LaComb</b>: By 1966
we cared about containment, and I cared about it, because it was the same as it
is today. If we don't keep all the detonation products in close we don't
accomplish what we want to accomplish. We lose our experiments. On Double Play,
which was in June of '66, after we had problems with Red Hot in March, Discus
Thrower in May, and Pile Driver in June, Jack Noyer came out and said, “How long
will it take you to build an overburden plug?" So, we built an overburden
plug in five days. We put that plug in because our containment record wasn't
very good. We already had a gas-seal door in the drift, so when we ended up we
had, in general, the same kind of configuration we do nowadays, although we
didn't have a lot of the things we do now, like cable gas blocks. That plug was
strictly for public safety and health. It wasn't going to help our experiments
at all.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think at that
time DASA had anybody who was designated as the person to be concerned about
containment. There wasn't really anyone who was given that responsibility,
other than Jack Noyer. Being the kind of person he was, he tried to worry about
it all. A person I listened to was Wendell Weart, from Sandia. He was the one
who came out when we had questions regarding how should the stemming be placed,
should the hook drift be left open or should it be backfilled - those kinds of
things. Mel Merritt was another one who helped.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was about that time
that they started doing calculations with a bunch of folks who were with
General Atomics. It started out with some GA folks involved, and there was,
right after Double Play, some RAND people involved. For Door Mist, in '67, it
was those contractors who were doing the calculations, and were saying we want
this kind of grout with this kind of strength, and so forth. As far as the
overburden plug and the gas-seal door went, that was more or less our
engineering problem. There were no real criteria.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, there wasn't anybody
in DASA, in the Door Mist time frame, in 1967, saying it was this or that, that
DASA wanted. The contractors were saying, and saying more or less directly to
myself and the Test Group Director, "This is what DASA wants."
Somebody said they wanted a plug, or particular kinds of grout, but it wasn't
my job to define those things, only from the standpoint that I tried to make
sure we got the materials that the" experts" thought they wanted.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right after Door Mist,
where we had more problems, Noyer told me, "That won't happen again.
You're going to take care of this." I said, "Yes sir." We could
see we were going to have to pay some significant attention to protecting the
experiments, and to stopping leaks. So, after Door Mist, for every test I sat
down, and I wrote out the criteria for the grouts; what the velocity should be,
the strength should be at least this, and so on. And I set down criteria as to
how things were going to be done, and what should be done. I worked fairly
closely with the people doing the calculations, although I didn't understand
what they were doing, at that time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was, in our program,
always a constant threat that the people funding the experiments would decide
that the possibility that they would lose a lot of their data was too big to
take a chance on. That's one of the reasons DASA tried to turn things around so
rapidly after the four in a row in '66. I don't think it was so much a big
concern about the fact that we were releasing a little radiation to the atmosphere.
It was the loss of the experiments, and our credibility. I think that has
always been a factor, and still is.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About that time we
formed what we called the Stemming And Containment Panel Junior, or SACPAN
Junior, which was a working group. It was a real mixture. There was Court
McFarland from headquarters DNA, who was an aeronautical engineer, but very interested
in materials behavior. There was Ben Grody, who had a doctor's degree in
geology, and Bob Bjork, who was, and is, an excellent physicist, myself, and
Jerry Kent. That group, in my opinion, really turned our containment program
around. I think that group was the real foundation of the DNA containment program.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Baneberry happened
we were working on Misty North. We were also getting ready to field Diagonal
Line. We had to go and present a risk-benefit analysis for the Diagonal Line
shot to get permission to fire it, because some guy named Jim Carothers, on the
Panel, said it was going to leak. Actually that turned out to be good, because
it did leak, and we had gone through it, and they had okayed it with that
possibility in mind. So, they weren't surprised. We also had to do that for
Misty North, because there wasn't a whole lot of confidence. Fortunately, that
one contained.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also had the
presentations we had to make to the CEP, and there were problems with some of
the early shots when we presented our material, in getting our ideas across
about what we were trying to do. I was talking to Carl Keller one day, and we
were kicking ideas about this problem back and forth. He said something about
vessels, and I said, "You know, it might be worth thinking about
that." So, it was when he and I were talking that the seed was planted, I
think. I decided there had to be a logical way to present this material, so you
could say, "That will be coming in this section here." So, I sat down
and I said, "Okay, we've got three vessels, nested together, and each one
backing up the ones inside it." So, I started writing up the presentation
based on the three vessel concept. I made out the outlines, and then went back
and started writing how you would do it. They're still using some of the same
words today.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In '74 DNA hired Carl
Keller to be the Containment Scientist, and early on he began to develop an
experimental and calculational program to try to understand some things about
what was going on. Through the years, thirty to forty percent of our effort
with Pac Tech and S-Cubed has been in research, to do something new and different,
to find out something. We've got to do our production work that's associated
with the test, but it's essential to me that we still keep enough effort in
there to try to find out if there isn't something there, something we're
missing. I always have the feeling there's a shadow lurking around the corner.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Keller</b>: When I
came to DNA I think the title of the position was Containment Scientist, and
there was a job description associated with that, as the Civil Service
requires. That job description had been developed by Jay Davis, my predecessor
at DNA by more than a year, and by the Director of the Test Directorate. This
was a new job description, with their new concept of what the Containment Scientist
ought to be doing.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span class="calibre10">At that time DNA had numerous
problems, and they had decided that they needed a heavier gun in the
Containment Scientist position. They upgraded the position from a GS-14 to a
GS-1S, which meant they could offer more pay. I know that they had solicited
several senior people in the containment business to take that job - people far
more senior than I was. Those people, I suspect, were already above that pay
grade, and probably well established in the Laboratories. I wouldn't say I was
the bottom of the barrel, but I was certainly not their first choice for the
position.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an interesting
environment at DNA. They hadn't had any recent leaks, but they had had some real
encounters with the Containment Evaluation Panel. I remember one of their
presentations to the Panel where they had decided not to present any of the mechanical
closures, because they felt those were only relevant to sample protection.
Therefore, the DNA people who were presenting the event refused to present any
details about the closures, because that was irrelevant to containment. Well,
the Panel refused to categorize the shot, because they thought the closures
were relevant to containment. Then Phil Opedahl, who was the Test Group
Director on that event - I believe it was Husky Ace - stood up and said,
"Just a minute. Mr. Chairman, could we have a short recess?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the recess it was,
"We'll provide you with any of the information you want." It was
pretty clear where the concept that the mechanical closures were not
containment features came from, because for many years thereafter Joe LaComb
still insisted that the MAC's were not containment features. I never agreed
with him on that point, and so we always described them fully in the CEP documents.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the concerns was
that it handicapped the Test Director to have all these non-containment
features included in the containment presentation. But it was decided by the
Panel that those features were important to containment. And the Panel was right.
You can say with confidence that after Mighty Oak those features were thought
to be very important. So, that's an old concept that's been abandoned, but I
don't think DNA totally abandoned it until a couple of years ago.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I came to DNA their
containment program was really being managed by S-Cubed. There was no
Containment Scientist, and had not been one for over a year. DNA was doing as
well as they could with the few military people they had, some of whom were quite
new to the business. I wouldn't say they were desperate, but they were really
being controlled by the contractors. DNA had very little in the way of
technical capability in-house, so they really relied almost completely on their
contractors, and S-Cubed was happy to step in and supply all the advice the DNA
needed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For me it was a totally
new environment, dealing with contractors, because when I was at Los Alamos
contractors were considered second-class citizens; rude, mercenary, science-for-hire
kind of people. They are still mentioned with a sneer. It was at DNA that I
discovered that contractors did offer far more than you'd ever believe from the
way they were considered at Los Alamos. I found they really were responsive,
partly because you controlled the purse strings, but also because they were
very capable. My whole staff was essentially contractors, and over the next ten
years I gained a great deal of respect for them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole concept of
contracting for support does isolate you a bit from your staff, but you do
define what the deliverable is to be, and what the price will be, and what the
schedule will be. I found that I got results from the contractors much more
predictably than, say, a program manager at Los Alamos would get from his
staff. That's because his staff might be scattered all over the Laboratory, and
he was always competing with other programs in the Laboratory for the attention
of those people he needed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found I very much
enjoyed the contracting process as a way of doing a program. It really worked,
and we got a lot of good results, though I was always worried when the
contractors agreed with me. Was it because I had control of the money, or was
it because they thought I was correct? And I was never sure.</span></p>

<h2>Chapter 5: The Nevada Test Site</h2>
<br>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During 1948 and 1949 a committee headed by Lt. Gen. E. R. Quesada developed a list of
five potential sites that might be used for continental nuclear tests. The
candidates were the White Sands Proving Grounds in New Mexico, Pimlico Sound in
North Carolina, Dugway-Wendover Proving Grounds in Utah, an area between Fallon
and Tonopah in central Nevada, and the Las Vegas-Tonopah Gunnery Range in
Nevada. In 1950, after the approval by President Truman of continental testing,
some 1360 square miles of the Gunnery Range were turned over to the AEC for the
conduct of nuclear tests. The Nevada Proving Grounds, now known as the Nevada
Test Site, currently has an area slightly larger than the state of Rhode
Island, and lies some 70 miles northwest of Las Vegas.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There
are various criteria which could be used in the selection of an area to be used
for nuclear testing, the importance of each of which would depend on the
judgment of the person or persons making the selection. Remoteness from
populated areas, availability of air, rail, and highway transport, security,
and so on are important criteria. Another thing that would be of importance is
the type of nuclear tests to be conducted, or which might be conducted,
although that did not appear to be a factor in either the selection of the
Pacific Proving Ground, or the Nevada Proving Grounds. Enewetak and Bikini, for
instance, were too small to do experiments to explore the effects of the
detonations on structures or military hardware, Crossroads notwithstanding. The
possibility of underground detonations was not considered when the selection of
the Nevada Proving Grounds was made.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What
would be the geologic characteristics of a suitable site, where underground
detonations were to occur, and the radioactive products were to be contained?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I'm of the opinion that we have
not actually had to address that problem, thanks to the fact that we are where
we are. In other words, we were blessed, in a sense, by being put down in a
place not of our choosing; the Nevada Test Site. We have made the best of that
without having the freedom of choosing where in the world we'd like to go to do
the best underground testing.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we've understood from
the Soviets, and from the French, and from anybody else who's tried to test,
we've had a wealth of different sites and different media, with opportunities
for different kinds of tests. If we want to test in granite, we can; we don't
have to go to North Africa. If we want to test below the water table, we can.
If we want to test above the water table, we can. We can test in various kinds
of alluvium, and in various kinds of tuff. Most places in the world are not
blessed with all of those opportunities. So, without having had any opportunity
to select the site, we have been lucky, if lucky is the right word, in being
able to find a great variety of media within the confines of the Test Site.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Do you
mean that if in the fifties someone had said, "We want you to test
underground. And, not one atom out. Pick a good spot, in the United States, and
you can have it,” we probably wouldn't have picked a place as good as the Test
Site?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Brownlee</b>:
Absolutely. If we had used our heads we would have been in terrible trouble. We
were very slow to learn all of the different opportunities we had for the
different kinds of tests that we wanted to do. For example, did we want to mine
a big room? At the Test Site we could. Did we want to do something and throw a
little dirt on it? We could. Did we want to lay something out on the surface
and shoot it? We could. We could do that because in those very early years we
were sufficiently removed from anybody that we essentially had everything
around us, and a long way around us, under our control, with a few exceptions.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we went underground
the number of milk cows in the fallout pattern we might have would sometimes be
three, or six. The number of people for whom you would have to provide the
means of evacuation, were that to be needed, would be twelve, or twenty. What's
happened with the Test Site since those days is that people have moved right to
the boundaries of the Test Site, and there are literally hundreds and thousands
of everything and anything. But people see the Test Site as it is, and they
don't understand that it was selected as it was.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early, it seems to me,
we had an emplacement hole and we used it. Even after Baneberry we still used
the hole that was there. We had them stockpiled, and we tended to use them. It
took us quite a little while after Baneberry before we really selected a site
we wanted for the shot. I think it's only in relatively recent times that the
containment people have had some input, really, as to which hole they wanted
for a given shot. There are times when we will have a deep hole, and shoot near
the top of it. That deep hole was drilled for something else, but we make use
of it. I can find all kinds of examples, still, where we don't select the site
as logically as we are able. We do things in tuff that might better be done in
alluvium, and so forth.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is one other
thing, and that's the water flow. I think it's bad business to get plutonium
into an aquifer. It happens that at the Test Site the water doesn't go
anywhere. To the first approximation, it just sits there. Al Graves didn't know
that either, when he selected the Test Site. And so from a radiological point
of view, a hydrologic point of view, the Nevada Test Site is peculiarly able to
support testing.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, on
two or three occasions we've found debris from shots at places that we had no
expectation of it being. That tells me it's entirely possible that things are
going on down there for which we have only had an occasional whiff. And that we
are not anything like as knowledgeable about the water flow as we think we are.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: I have
talked with the folks who calculate what might occur in different types of
rocks, if you were to shoot in them. They don't like very hard rocks like
granite because of the tensile cracks that show in the calculations. And they
don't like very weak rocks because they don't sustain the residual stress
fields thought to be important for containment. Something like tuff or alluvium
turns out to be just about the best you can do. Isn't that surprising? Believe
the calculations or not, they imply that if we were in some other site it
probably wouldn't be nearly as good.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Brownlee</b>: We
couldn't have possibly done as well, because I don't think there's any other
place that could be as good. Now, that's said out of ignorance too, but let's look
at Pahrump, which was actually considered. The whole history of the world would
have been different. The water table there is so high that all of our testing would
have been different, and we would probably have had the Russian experience of
having something come out from each test. Or we'd have spent so much money that
we couldn't have afforded it. I bet you anything that if we had started out
testing in Pahrump either we would have abandoned it, or we would have still
been there and, for example, we would never have had room for the British. All
kinds of things would have been different. It's really true, I think, that the
selection of the Test Site actually was a branching point in history. We took
that new road without ever knowing why or what we were doing, but I feel it was
a very fundamental action.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an aside, we are in
the process of losing the Test Site for underground testing, and no one seems
to know or care. The majority of the NVO budget is now devoted to things other
than underground testing. And their interests are in Waste Management and
various other kinds of things. They don't mind bringing in all kinds of people,
and building new things, and doing new experiments. They would sell off any
part of the Test Site to keep NVO green, and they have so cluttered up the Test
Site with other kinds of activities, which are now sacred, that it's
increasingly difficult to get a shot off.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you haven't seen
anything yet. I actually challenged one of the Assistant Managers at NVO a few
months ago, and said, "I believe the biggest threat that we have to the
Test Site is NVO. It's not the people on the borders. It's not Las Vegas. It's
not the anti's. It's ourselves. We're our biggest enemies." I didn't know
whether I could get away with saying that, but he pondered it a while and said,
"I see what you mean, and I believe you're right. We really have plans for
doing all kinds of things." They're preparing for a moratorium, and so
they're going to do all kinds of things.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They imported a lot of
activities during the last moratorium. And when we go into another test
moratorium, which I figure will come one of these days, I don't believe we'll
ever go back to being able to use the Test Site again. I've said what I think
are the characteristics of the Site that are to our advantage, and I believe that
there is hardly anybody in NVO who understands them. They do not appreciate
what they have. They do not appreciate what it means to have such a place.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that as long
as there's a nuclear stockpile we have to have the ability to address questions
which may arise. That might be continued testing, or it might not. It might
mean a nuclear test, or it might not. I'm talking about questions which may
arise, and we have to have a place where we can go to answer them. Nowadays, I
visualize that being underground. Even chemical experiments could be
underground, and not on the surface. We need a variety of ways to be ready to
answer a variety of questions. So, we need alluvium, and granite, and tuff, and
shale, and dry, and wet, and space, and mesas, and valleys. We need it all,
because we do not know which part of it we can give up. I believe we will have a
nuclear stockpile for at least the next four decades. Forty years. I can't
conceive of getting rid of it in less than forty years’ time. I would like to
think we can, but I can't believe that we'll be able to do that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you look at what's
happened at NTS in the last forty years, it's an exponential curve. And if we
have any kind of a moratorium it will get worse. With Baneberry we stopped
testing, and at the end of six months, every week we delayed it was harder to
start. We almost didn't get started up again; it got harder and harder as time went
on. I think that if there is any kind of a moratorium, it will be that way
again. And so, I almost despair over the loss of our Test Site, because I think
it's happening, and NVO couldn't care less because they have no appreciation of
what I've been trying to say.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shouldn't say,
"no appreciation" because I've been lecturing to them, and waving my
arms at them, and writing things down and showing it to them. But it doesn't
take. After all, we don't have to pay any attention to what Brownlee's saying.
We've got this waste management program, and the President has said, Secretary Watkins
has said, "We've got to clean up. That's the urgent thing." So, NVO
is no longer interested in stockpiles and testing; that's just way down on the
list. You noticed in the memo we got from Watkins, where he outlined all the
things DOE did, that he never once mentioned nuclear tests at all? It's not
listed in his long list of things that had to be looked at. Nuclear test is not
mentioned. So, the DOE has little appreciation of what I'm saying.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what's worse,
neither do the Laboratories. This question that you've asked me about the Test
Site I think is an exceedingly important question. We ought to recognize what
the Site means to us, and I think we don't. Notice that I've said,
"Despite all the opportunities we've had to use it cleverly, we
haven't." And now I'm saying, "Even though we've learned as much as
we have, we're getting ready to throw it away."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the reason why I
spent quite a few months writing a document on the preservation of the Test
Site. And I got Troy Wade to finally enunciate the DOE policy on the
preservation of the Test Site, which in effect says to NVO and ALOO that any
decision made about the day-to-day operation of the Test Site has to be made with
the idea that we're going to preserve it for testing. I was hoping by that
means to get something down on paper which then I could wave in NVO's face,
saying, "When<i class="calibre13"> </i>you bring in these rug merchants, that is contrary to
the policy of the preservation of the Test Site."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But doggone it, there is
something kind of sacred about the Test Site nowadays. Put away the
conservationists, and the preservationists, and the purists. We have done some
things there that are special in history. They are. In the history of the
world, a thousand years from now, that's going to be something kind of special.
We ought to have that in mind as we act, but our concern is only this year's
budget. That's all. And we ought to be bigger than that; we ought to be
thinking more broadly than that. I'm saying, "Here we have the Test Site.
We could use it much more cleverly than we do, but we're only interested in the
current budget with this fiscal year's shots. That's our only concern, and
therefore, we just do things as they come." I think that's a grave
mistake. I doubt that we will ever do it any other way because that's the way
our government is, and that's the way we are. But I wish it were otherwise, and
I would like to really understand more about containment by doing things of various
kinds at the Test Site.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point I want to
make. I only learned in recent years that when it comes to space you don't need
a nuclear test to affect it. You can seriously affect space with just a little
bit of energy. If you have what the United States government assumes is empty space,
a vacuum, it doesn't take very much mass there to change it. Actually, the
United States government is mistaken, because it's not empty at all. It's
already cluttered up with a lot of things, and so when we put something else up
there and put a little energy there, it interacts with the stuff that's already
there that we've put there. This is not appreciated. Well, I believe it's a
grave mistake to do experiments in space that can be done underground, or in
tanks, or in other places. And the NTS has the capacity to allow us to do many
space-like experiments. Now, they say, "Oh,<i class="calibre13"> </i>you can't have a
mountain that will hold a vacuum." A lot of the key questions that you
need to answer in space are not those questions, and they could be answered
easily in Nevada. So, I think we ought to preserve the Test Site for space
research, strangely enough.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: That
does seem strange.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Brownlee</b>: But let
me use this analogy; I said we originally thought of using the Test Site on the
way to the Pacific. I think we ought to use the Test Site on the way to space.
And so I'm not really talking about space experiments, I'm talking about some
stepping stones on the way there. And for reasons that are lost to me, there's almost
nobody who understands that yet, although I think they will in time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DNA is leading us there.
I think they're leading us in that direction, and eventually these things will
occur to people. Now, when they do, will the Test Site be available? I'm afraid
it won't be, and so that gives me grave concern.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I'm doing here is
taking an exceedingly broad view, and I know that. Let me summarize all this up
by saying, "I think we need to look at the Test Site with much broader,
much wider-angled glasses than we have the habit of doing." I feel very
strongly about that, but unfortunately I can't convert anybody.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From
the first detonations at the Test Site in 1951 until 1957, when the first
underground shots were fired, the geologic structure of the Test Site was of little
importance. There were a number of air drops, devices were placed on towers,
suspended from balloons, fired on the surface, and two that were emplaced at
the modest depths of 12 and 67 feet. The only information about the geology that
was required was enough to allow the design of the footings for the towers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
the Plumbbob operation in 1957 the first underground events were fired. It
began to matter what lay beneath the surface, for the tunnels that were being
dug and the emplacement holes that were being drilled.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenhofel</span></b><span class="calibre10">: In the early days there were
two aspects of Survey work here. One was ground water contamination. What was
the water table like, and where was it. So there was some drilling done, and
ground water testing. The contamination of water was the impetus for that. The
other thing was mapping. There were some early explorers who came through the
country, and there were geologists attached to them sometimes, so there was a
general knowledge of the Test Site area. There had been some mining in this region,
but there were no geologic maps. The first overall report on the geology of the
Nevada Test Site was done by two geologists named Johnson and Hibbard, who were
assigned out here with the Army. That was probably in about 1952. No
comprehensive study had been done until those two Army guys mapped the Test
Site.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On their map they
plotted the kinds of rocks that occur at the surface. If the rocks dip at an
angle, you plot on the map that dip. You end up with a map that shows the
occurrence of the various rocks that you can see at the surface. You have to
have a good base map so you know where you are, so you can be relatively
accurate about where the various formations are. The U.S. Geological Survey
published that report later, (Geology of the Atomic Energy Commission Nevada
Proving Grounds Area, Nevada, Geological Survey Bulletin 1021-K) when the
interest in underground events began to grow.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing that
happened when the underground program began to materialize was that the USGS
said, “Well, we've got to have modern topographic maps." Those are the
quadrangle maps that are used today. So, that part of the USGS which is called
the Topographic Mapping Division flew the area for aerial photographs and then
made the topographic maps. Those were done, and the next thing was to map the
surface geology on the new topographic maps. It was in the late 1950's to early
1960's when the geologic mapping was done. And, they're the maps that are still
used today.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: In '58 we
opened an office in Denver, and that same year they said, “Ah ha, you're a
photo-geologist. We have this big Nevada Test Site out there. We want you to
analyze the western part of it, using photos." I said, “All right,"
never having looked at volcanic rocks before, but sure, we can do anything. If
we can find uranium, we can find volcanic rocks. So that's how I got involved
in Test Site work. In 1961 I joined what they called the Special Projects
Branch, which was formed to do work on the Test Site. And then I took over and
started doing photo-geologic techniques for the mapping of the Test Site.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The USGS had been
involved in '57, '58 in the tunnel work out in the Rainier Mesa area doing some
of the pioneer work for doing shots in tunnels, and containment in tunnels.
Prior to Rainier the USGS did two high explosive shots in tunnels in Rainier
Mesa. Those were right where the miners' camp is now. They were in east Rainier
Mesa; not Rainier Mesa proper. They were a little to the west of the Area 12
camp.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Twenhofel</b>: The
Survey shot the first contained high explosive tests at the Test Site. There
were two; ten tons and fifty tons. They were done in Rainier Mesa, in what were
called the USGS tunnels. As far as I know, those ten and fifty ton shots were
the only high explosive tests done at that time. They were done entirely by the
USGS, for containment purposes. They were steps in scaling up to Rainier.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Do you
recall how the USGS become involved in detonating rather large amounts of high
explosives?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: I guess
they were sitting there, minding their own business, and one day got called by
somebody in the AEC who said, "We need somebody who has experience in
mining. You dig holes in the earth, so you must know something about it."
Of course, nobody knew anything about it. Including me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the first reason we
got involved with the Test Site was to understand what the rocks were. And
that's how the mapping started up in the Rainier Mesa area. The USGS started
mapping in quadrangles, so to speak. The Rainier Mesa was done first, and then it
expanded from there. During the moratorium was when we did most of the geologic
mapping in the northern part of the Test Site; Rainier Mesa, and over toward
Oak Spring Butte, and the Climax Stock. That's when the quadrangle series
mapping started; it started out to be three quadrangles. I think they're called
Tippapah, Rainier, and White Rock Spring. When we finished that we had a big
celebration and said, "Hey, we're done with the Test Site. We'll never
have to come back. We finished all this mapping, and we're done." That was
in '60 or '61, and then, lo and behold, the moratorium was over, and things
picked up very actively.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Do you
know how it was that Rainier Mesa was chosen for the Rainier event? Do you
think it just that the mesa happened to be there, or was there a particular
geologic reason to pick it?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orkild</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, I think both. I think it
was there, it was a nice mesa, and it had very mineable rocks. I don't think
anybody worried about the physical properties of the rocks; it was just a place
to put a hole in the ground. The tuffs are easy to mine; they're very competent,
they hold up quite well, and you can make a tunnel in them very easily. It's
easy mining really, better than mining in very hard rock.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By
1957 the USGS had a role at the NTS that has continued to the present time.
Both Los Alamos and Livermore have had a continuing involvement with the Site,
and both of the Laboratories established organizations with people permanently
stationed in Nevada. However, the USGS did not.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Twenhofel</b>: None
of us ever moved to Las Vegas. There was a lot of pressure from the AEC to move
the USGS group, because it was a fairly sizable group as things developed in
underground testing, but we resisted that. Jim Reeves was the Manager, from Albuquerque,
and he tried to exert pressure to have the USGS group move here. Studies were
made about the costs of air travel, and per diem, and so on, but the move never
came about. It was not the people who resisted; the organization resisted. The
USGS is somewhat paranoid about becoming beholden to outside money. We do take
it, but we're going to keep our independence and our objectivity. There was a
real fear that if this group, assigned to work at the Test Site, would go there
and be officed near or in the AEC, the people in it might lose their
independence and their objectivity. That's a strong feeling in the USGS. So we
never moved down here; we commuted and lived at Mercury.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time we had one
person stationed here, and we rotated. We had a liaison office, you might call it.
The guys would come down here for a month and be in the liaison position, but
it just didn't work. That person had no authority.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Jenkins</b>: Since
1966 I have put my roots down on the Test Site. I think the geologic work at
the Test Site is fantastically interesting. There are very few places where so
much drilling has been done, and so much data have been collected. There are a
lot of concepts being developed as a result of the exploration at the Site.
That is what makes it a really fascinating place to work.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Flats there are
about nine hundred holes that have given information we can use. Up on the
Mesa, perhaps a hundred. Nowhere else in the world do you have a buried
volcanic caldera with that much exploration. It's just unreal. Nobody else can afford
it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>:
Probably not. Well, the Department of Energy hasn't done that just for you
geologists, out of the goodness of its heart. Do you get a good amount of
information out of those holes?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Jenkins</b>: Oh yes.
And as time goes on, more information is gotten out of them. When I first got
here we were getting caliper logs and drill-hole bit cuttings; occasionally
some core. That was about it. Now we know something about the magnetic
properties of the rock. We have good information on the density of the units, in
situ, and of course the electrical resistivity logging has developed as time
has gone on, but we don't really use all that we could of that. We can get the
in-situ water contents now. There's the thorium-potassium ratio from the logs,
and in our work that helps in determining which units have clay. The technology
has developed by leaps and bounds since I got here. It's a real opportunity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: From
the point of view of the person selecting a site for an event, it appears that
you could consider the Test Site as made up of three general areas. There's the
Yucca Flat area, which is deep alluvium over tuffs, there's Rainier Mesa, which
has extensive layers of tuffs, and then there is Pahute Mesa, which has various
lava flows throughout.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: That's
correct.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: How
would you describe Rainier Mesa?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: It's a
mesa of layered volcanic rocks. They were laid down essentially horizontally;
some by water and some by air, and compacted into a very cohesive mass of rock.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Off to the west there
were a couple of volcanos, and they were spewing ash and debris out. Some of
that was flowing with the wind and settling out as dust. Other material that
was blown up further came down as big clots, and some came down as hot glowing
ash. These volcanos were to the west of the Test Site proper, over in what we
call the Timber Mountain area, but the actual source for those rocks we don't
know. There were never actual lava flows on Rainier, because it's too far away
from the sources.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The later rocks, like
the Rainier Mesa tuff, came from the Timber Mountain Caldera. The Grouse Canyon
tuffs came from the Silent Canyon Caldera. Those calderas are very close - only
ten, twenty miles away. On Pahute Mesa you're very close to the sources of all
of the lavas, so you do have flows and pillows &ndash; one going out to the west, one
going to the east, some going to the south, some going over the top of others,
and so on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you're looking at
in Rainier are the outflow sheets from those volcanic features. Some of the
material rolled and surged down the mountainside, and came to rest in the place
where Rainier Mesa is today. Time went on, and some thirteen, fourteen million years
ago, maybe ten, Yucca Flat started to subside, and left Rainier Mesa as a high monolith,
essentially as you see it. Its formation was accelerated by erosion, and the
cliffs formed, and the rocks from the face fell into the flats. In Yucca, the
faults that go down through the valley occasionally move over time, and form
scarps, and the valley spreads a little more and settles some more. It is still
moving today.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: On
Rainier Mesa there is a layer of hard rocks - the cap rock. Is that why Rainier
Mesa is there?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: That's
right. It has preserved Rainier Mesa itself, being a hard rock. Essentially
what the Rainier Mesa cap rock is doing is protecting the very vitric, soft
Paintbrush Tuff beneath it. Now, that cap rock, the Rainier Mesa member, has a
lot of vertical fractures in it, due to the way it was formed. As it cooled, it
shrunk and formed into square blocks and polygonal blocks, and that's very typical
of that type of rock unit deposit. You see the same thing on Pahute Mesa. You
would see the same thing beneath Yucca Flat, if you could see through the
alluvium. It is what happened to any of the units that are welded, or have some
form of welding. They start as a very hot layered mass, which sticks together
and compacts, and then as it cools it cracks.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: There
have been a number of tunnels that have been mined into Rainier. Are they all
being put into the same block of material?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>:
Essentially. They're all in the Tunnel Beds. There are very different units in
the Tunnel Beds, but essentially they are all the same rock types. Except P
tunnel, which is much higher in the stratigraphic section. It's up in what we
call the Paintbrush, which is above the Tunnel Beds. But I don't think those
tuffs are very different. The physical properties are very, very similar. The porosity
might be higher in some of them, especially as you get into the upper units
that are not as welded, not as altered. This is also true of any event down in
Yucca Flat, or in Pahute.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: What
are Paleozoic rocks?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: They are
the older rocks that form the basement of the Yucca Flat, and the whole Test
Site, essentially. They are the limestones, or the dolomites, or the shales.
They were there before the volcanos - many, many millions of years before the
volcanos.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: There
might have been a time when I could have walked around on them. What would they
have looked like?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: Just like
the Rocky Mountains. And then there were the eruptions which filled the various
valleys and troughs.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: In
Yucca Flat, are the tuffs below the alluvium the same rocks that are in Rainier
Mesa?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>:
Essentially. The tuffs have exactly the same stratigraphic sequence on Rainier
Mesa as ·you have on Yucca Flat. Once upon a time they were connected. The
Grouse Canyon was a layer that was deposited probably all over Yucca Flat and
Rainier Mesa. Now you find it on the top of Oak Spring Butte, and also many thousands
of feet below in Yucca Flat.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: So,
most of the things that you say about the tuff units on Rainier Mesa should
also be true of the tuff units in Yucca.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: That's
correct. The alteration is very much the same. The physical properties are
very, very similar. And very likely there are blocks just like those in Rainier
Mesa.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Jenkins</b>: Right
under the alluvium in Yucca Flat is the Rainier Mesa member, which is the same
ash flow tuff that you find on Rainier Mesa and on Pahute.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carroll</b>: With one
exception, which is the alteration phenomenon. That stuff has been there for
twelve, fourteen million years. Having been there that length of time, there's
another imprint that goes upon the rock. That's the effect of moisture, and of
heat. There is water coming down and creating accessory minerals &ndash; the clays,
and the zeolites. And although one argues in certain places that this is Tunnel
Bed A, and that is Tunnel Bed A, in Area 3 it may not be altered as opposed to
the bed in Area 9. Stratigraphy to me has always been a problem, because I
don't like people to tell me the name of a rock. Like "metasediment,"
which is a popular term, I think, in the Soviet Union now. That name means
nothing to me as a geophysicist. What is it? Tell me the density, tell me the porosity,
tell me something more than a name you've made up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Rambo</b>: In terms
of material properties, those rocks beneath the alluvium in Yucca may have had
a whole different experience than the ones in Rainier. It's the same ashfall,
but from the materials properties view I think there are some differences. If
you do shear strength measurements on the tuffs in the tunnels, they will look quite
a bit different from the measurements we do out in the Flat. And take the
Grouse Canyon layer. Out in the Flat that means something highly porous, and
usually to us means something very weak. In the tunnels it is a very strong,
highly welded member, and I wouldn't say it had anywhere near the same
gas-filled porosity as in the Flats. But it's the same low density unit.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Miller</b>: I never
did consider the tuff directly beneath the alluvium in Yucca to be the same as
Rainier Mesa tuff. It drills differently. The Rainier Mesa tuff you run into in
Area 12, and Areas 19 and 20, is one hard rock. Whatever is underneath the alluvium
in Yucca Flat is not a hard rock. It's not that much more difficult to drill
than the alluvium. The fact is, often times the penetration rate was not that
much different than the alluvium. In Yucca, where you usually hit the hard
drilling is when you hit the Paleozoic; when you hit the limestone or dolomite.
The tuff underneath the alluvium in Yucca Flat is a different rock than you find
in Area 20.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: In Yucca,
how thick is this layer of Rainier Mesa tuff?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Jenkins</b>: It's
quite variable. On the east side of the valley it's quite thin - maybe a
hundred feet. In the thickest part of the Flat, where the unit is thickest,
probably close to five hundred feet. And on Pahute Mesa it's very much a
thousand feet thick all over. The Rainier is the surface unit there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: If I
were to go to some place in Yucca Flat, and drill down through the alluvium, I
might be able to drill several hundred feet into this Rainier Mesa member, and
have the working point in it?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Jenkins</b>: Right.
It's been done often.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carothers: Well, it
would seem that with the number of joints, or cracks that is in that rock,
there would be a lot of pathways for gas to get to the top of that Rainier Mesa
layer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Jenkins</b>: It's
true they could be quite convenient pathways.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Yucca
Flat and Pahute Mesa are two very different regions, aren't they, in terms of
structure? Pahute is composed largely of lavas, and Yucca is mostly tuffs of
one kind and another, covered by the alluvium.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Jenkins</b>: Yes, I
agree with you, but the same generic units, from the same volcanic centers, are
in both places. And you have almost the same rock on Rainier as caps a lot of
Pahute Mesa. Now, the stratigraphic section on Rainier is rather compressed as
compared to that on Pahute Mesa. In other words, there are units on Rainier
that are very lithologically similar to those we find in Pahute Mesa, but they're
compressed. They aren't quite as thick. There was not as deep a hole to fill,
if you will.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Pahute
was added to the original Test Site in 1964. Why was that area chosen, aside
from the fact that it was directly adjacent to the existing site?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Jenkins</b>: I think
the biggest factor that led to the identification of Pahute Mesa as a testing
area was the gravity data work. That work identified low density material, at
depth, in this big circular situation. And of course, the good thinkers could
look to the south and see Timber Mountain, which is an exposed caldera. And the
good thinker said, “Well, this must be another caldera. Therefore it has a
variety of volcanic rocks at depth, instead of the Paleozoic rocks which we
find underneath Yucca Flat".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a number of
exploratory drill holes that the USGS did. Pahute Mesa 1 and 2, Ue20f, Ue20j -
the water well, Ue19c, - and Ue19b. All of them were quite deep. Ue20f was
fifteen thousand or so feet, and a lot of them went greater than five thousand.
And so, we got a pretty good picture of what we were dealing with there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: I
think of Pahute as being a different type of containment structure from Rainier
Mesa, or Yucca Flat, because it has layers which are very hard rock.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Jenkins</b>: The
lavas. Well, the lavas are probably the only difference, because you have
densely welded ash flow tuffs in all areas. The Grouse Canyon in the Flat is
probably airfall or nonwelded ashflow. Of course, it's thin. Under parts of
Rainier Mesa, and under Pahute Mesa, it's densely welded.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: Pahute
Mesa is where the lava was molten, and flowed out from an active volcano, which
was very, very close - within miles. Normally the hot lavas don't go more than
ten miles away from their source. Being a viscous, gooey mass, they stay very
close. They went in one direction, then that would clog up, and then they went
in another direction. That's what really generated some of the blob bier
structures.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: What's
between the various lava flows on Pahute?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: Generally
material that was ejected out of the volcano as ash or brechiated rock, rock
that is broken up. Ash is hot volcanic material that is blown into the air and
then cooled. The molten rock comes out, and when it gets to the atmosphere it
vesiculates into a nice big frothy ball that becomes disaggregated, and falls
back to the surface.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deposits that are
what we call airfall, dropping onto the ground, will form a very thin rind.
Normally what you will see if you have any extreme topography between various
flows is that the rains have washed this airfall material into gullies and
other low spots. Many times you can see peculiar dips on the Mesa, and they are
on those slopes where the material has been deposited, and then washed off.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: There
would be considerable differences in the properties of the material in the lava
flows, and in those places filled with the ash, wouldn't there? Density
differences, for example.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: Sure. The
lavas could be very dense, and the ash flows could be very low density. There
are a number of density contrasts, especially going out of the very dense lavas
into the very vitric tuffs, back into dense rock, back into soft rock, and then
back into hard rock.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: In
Yucca, which in a sense is a somewhat less complex structure, people took a lot
of logging data and sample data, but in the first years they didn't do all of
that on Pahute. The geologists would say, "Well, the properties are
extrapolated in." How can you go to a structure like Pahute, which has
pillows of lava, and many kinds of layers, and do that?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Jenkins</b>: Because
on Pahute Mesa the units have better identification, and therefore a unit
there, a subunit, whatever, can be projected much better under Pahute Mesa than
it can be on the Flats where you really don't have that good a handle on what
the units are.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Is
that another way of saying that the units on Pahute Mesa are so different, one
from the other, that you can see them readily?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Jenkins</b>: Yes. The
units are so different, one from another, that they can be easily distinguished
one from another. That's a good statement. In the Flats you have the fallout of
all of this volcanic activity, and it's just very hard to distinguish among
them. Now of course, that depends on what kind of a scale you want your
physical properties on. If it's a very wide scale, then the whole unit between the
Timber Mountain tuff and the Paleozoic rocks could be generalized. On Pahute
you'd have to have parts of it here, and parts of it there, and other parts of
it over there in order to make that statement.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: I think
that, as far as we're talking about the physical parameters, there's no longer
a difference in the data gathering. It's true that most of the physical
properties were extrapolated from the key fifteen exploratory holes that were
drilled up there. You saw the same type of unit in the next hole, and said,
"All right, this is very similar. Therefore we'll extrapolate." And
there was really nothing wrong with that. It was very successful for
thirty-four events.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: That
depends on with whom you want to argue. There are some who might say,
"Yes, but all of those events were high enough in yield to be the kind of
shots that don't leak. You're just lucky that you only shoot high yield shots
in that very complex, little known, variable density medium. You try to shoot
low yield shots, as you do in Yucca, who knows what would happen? At nine hundred
feet or so for a ten kiloton shot, it might not be the same.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: I would
be very nervous with something like that, because of the Rainier Mesa tuff unit
that's at the surface there. That Rainier Mesa material has cooling cracks all
through it. It cooled as one unit. It came out in multiple flows, but it all
stacked up, very thick, and compressed. As it cooled, the cracks formed in the
vitrophyre in maybe a different pattern than they formed in the upper part of
it, but those cracks are essentially through-going. That layer is about a
thousand feet thick, and that means those fractures go down that far. Once you
drop below that layer, unless you're near a fault you have very few fractures
of that kind.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Then
if I shoot at sixteen hundred feet or so, I'm only a few hundred feet below
that layer. I don't have to go very far to get to those fractures. And then the
gases can move rather freely through the fractures, even if any single one
doesn't extend all the way through the unit.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: That's
right, if you only have the Rainier Mesa member as the rock at the top. That's
in Area 19. When you go over into Area 20, you have other units above the
Rainier. The events where you see late-time gas seepage are mostly over in Area
19, and they are directly related to whether the Rainier Mesa layer was near
the surface. West of there, other units, the Thirsty Canyon and the other ash
flows, sit on top of it, and those cracks are essentially sealed off at the
upper part. Late-time gases certainly came up into them somewhere, but they
didn't get to the surface because they could disperse into those thin, very
porous layers that were intertongued with denser units.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One
of the features of the Test Site that has been considered as possibly adversely
affecting the probability of successful containment are the faults that occur
throughout the site. Generally the faults with substantial displacements are
avoided - when they are known. Some faults, such as the one known as the
Carpetbag fault, are not detected until some movement occurs as a result of a
nearby detonation. How dangerous faults are with respect to containment is
largely unknown, and is a matter of individual judgment. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: At the
Test Site there are many faults, cracks that show that movement has taken
place.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: Yes, many
of them, some with up to forty meters of displacement in Rainier Mesa, where we
can see them in the tunnels. That's a large fault for Rainier Mesa, and it
would probably be the largest that you'll see there. And you do see
displacements down to inches in the tunnels. In Yucca there are faults with
much more displacement than that, but on those the displacement has to be inferred
from seismic surveys and exploratory holes. Normally when you see a fault it's
not one fault plane, but a series of fault planes that might make up a total
displacement of maybe ten feet, distributed on five or six of these faults .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These faults are held
very tightly together by the overburden. There are no open standing fractures.
They are a plane of weakness, but I don't think they're a plane of transport. I
don't think faults necessarily have to be bad for containment, but I think the
system should be aware of them, and plan accordingly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be nice to be
able to try a shot on the Yucca fault. Many years ago, on Pahute Mesa, there
was an event very close to a structure over in Area 20. That was back in the
Rae Blossom days. He said, “Let's try it. Let's see what happens." Nothing
happened. The fault moved very nicely, very handily, something like five or six
feet. But there was no reason to think it affected the containment. There was
no release.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: The
closest shot to the Yucca fault that I can remember was in '72. It was called
Oscuro, which was a Los Alamos shot fired on the east side of the Yucca fault,
fairly close.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: And close
to a very large northeast fault. My personal feeling is that it would have
vented if it hadn't collapsed when it did. I remember going out and looking at
the post-shot effects, and I said, “I don't know how this thing stayed in the
ground." Everything was standing open. The fracture that broke to the
northeast was standing open a good foot and a half or two feet at the surface, beyond
where the collapse had occurred. That northeast fault is in tension, and that's
the thing that would stand open, because there's nothing to close it up. (think
that was a very, very close experience. The only thing I think that saved it
was the collapse. If that had sat there for any length of time, I think we'd
have been hit.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: How do
you know whether a fault is under compression or is in tension?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orkild</span></b><span class="calibre10">: In certain cases I think we know
based on the overall structure. When we look at some of the northeast trending
faults off the Yucca Fault, we can say that very likely they are in tension -
they're pulling apart. That's how the basin-range formed in the first place.
There are areas within the Test Site that are under those conditions. That's
based on the physical parameters that they have found on drilling on the Mesa,
finding out the principal stress.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: You
mentioned the east side of the Yucca fault as an area that is in tension. Does
that mean the west side is in compression?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: No. They
both could be under compression, because one side is coming up, and the other
is going down, and they're both pushing together. It's the subsidiary faults
that come off of the Yucca fault that are being pulled apart.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upside of the Yucca
Fault has always been steered away from because you see all of these open,
standing fractures, which means that something has to be under tension and it's
pulling apart. You would assume that some of the downside would be under compression
because it's being pushed down. But there's another wrinkle to the Yucca Fault
- it also has lateral motion. One side is moving laterally with respect to the
other, and as you have that motion you can have tension along those northeast
fractures.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Would
this same situation obtain up on Rainier Mesa, where you might have tension and
compression areas? It's not a very big block.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: It's not
a very big block, and probably what it's doing is that all of it is moving
radially toward its edge. That's the way you would think it would happen - that
it would move toward the open-faced surface, toward Yucca or toward Pahute
Mesa.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Bill,
you have said many times over the years that you don't see that faults really
cause a containment problem, and they don't concern you particularly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Twenhofel</b>: I
don't think faults are a problem unless they move on the shot.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: How am
I going to know whether that will happen or not?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Twenhofel</b>: Well,
we don't really know that too well, but we know which ones have moved on past
shots. The Yucca fault, for instance, moves quite a bit, and there are others.
We try to avoid those because we have the concept, and I think it's valid, that
a fault isn't a perfect plane, so when they do move there may be openings created,
and that's a possible release path if you're near enough.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I concur with the
idea of avoiding the Yucca fault, because it moves. But many of the faults are
not going to move. There are two kinds of faults. There are tectonic faults
that are created by earth stresses, and they tend to be big things. Then there
are a lot of subsidence and compaction faulting that only occurs because the rock
is compressed a little bit here by the weight of the overlying rock, and so it
subsides a little bit - there's a little fault. Those things don't move, and I
don't think they're a factor.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that if a fault
goes right through the stress cage it's going to be compacted and tightened
right there, so it can't possibly be a path. When it's farther out where it can
move, I think it can be a factor, but I don't get alarmed by many of these
faults. But we can't be very quantitative about it. It's very subjective.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Weart</b>: Well, Pin
Stripe was an early vertical line-of-sight pipe shot that vented through a
fault. It was conducted in Area 5, and rather than being in a drill hole, it
was in a shaft that had been excavated. It had the latest in closures,<i class="calibre13"> </i>ball
valves, HE closures, everything. But, as we found out when we did an
investigation after it vented in a very massive way, all those features had
been circumvented. There was a fault that came into the shaft below these
features, and it provided an easy release path to the surface.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: The
release was through the fault itself?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weart</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes, we know it was. It was a
very clear example. When we reentered the top of the line-of-sight pipe the
seals were closed, and it was clean. And we could trace the fault path on the
surface of the ground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't a fault that
released material directly from the cavity, and I'm not sure that the Baneberry
fault did either, although on Baneberry the fault was much more closely
associated with the cavity than the fault on Pin Stripe. Whether or not Pin
Stripe would have contained if the fault hadn't been there I can't say for
sure, but it certainly was the easiest path. The shaft was clean above that point.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: There
are people who say, “The geology at the Test Site really doesn't matter as far
as containment goes, except in exceptional circumstances. We have fired so many
shots that we've probably encountered just about every kind of material and
situation that you can imagine. If it mattered it would have got us by now."
I emphasize they mean that statement only with respect to the Test Site, not
the world in general.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: I agree
that if you bury shots deep enough you don't have any problems.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Well,
that's true, I think. If you have all the money you want, and all the time you
want, you can certainly do that. But coaxial cable is expensive. Casing is
expensive. Drill holes are expensive. And when you get down below the water
table it begins to get very expensive. So, that's the kind of statement that is
true, but it's not very helpful in the real world. But certainly we have encountered
many different kinds of geologic situations, wouldn't you say, on those many
shots that haven't leaked?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: Yes, but
there are certain combinations of geologic conditions that can get you.
Baneberry is an example.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Rimer</b>: Take
Barnwell. There was a case where the containment lore about geology doesn't
matter came close to being disproved. John Rambo was the containment scientist.
It scared him enough that he had people go there and take cores, and measure
strength. I'm sure he got a lot of flak. He did a number of calculations, and we
did hydrofracture calculations, and everything said that the thing was going to
be contained. We came to the CEP with that information, and I forget who, but somebody
said, “We’ve never had a problem with a shot of this size at that depth of
burial. Therefore, we don't need to listen to these calculations."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span class="calibre10">The bottom line was, the thing
was going to be contained, but it was going to be contained with the potential
for a hydrofracture going much higher in the section that we had ever
hypothesized before from a tamped event. I emphasize tamped event, rather than
a cavity event.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on drilling rates
John knew there was something funny, and what was funny was, you had this
strong material right above the shot, which kept the cavity size small, and
therefore kept the cavity pressure up. Above that material was a layer of
weaker material which wouldn't support a high residual stress. So you had high cavity
pressure, and low strength rock above. That's the worst possible case you could
have, other than an open fracture leading to the surface. The empiricist said,
“Why should this matter?" Well, when it was shot, radiation got very
quickly up to the last plug.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Higher
than we've ever seen it on a shot of that yield.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Rimer</b>: And you
know what? It wasn't a coincidence. Geology mattered.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Brownlee</b>: I think
what I've learned is that the geology is only important when I'm on the edge.
Then it becomes important. But if I've got normal margins of safety, the
geology can be almost anything. I know that's true, because we've shot in
almost any geology, safely. If you've done your containment right, you don't have
to hang on the geology to determine what happens. But if you've done things wrong,
a trivial thing in the geology can make all the difference.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, don't misunderstand
me - I just believe that we ought to be so conservative that geology never
matters, and most of the time that's true. We are so conservative that the
geology doesn't matter. And so, I get very bored when they go into details that
are of no importance to this shot; none whatsoever. But they go into it because
after all, they've done this work, and they've got this geologic business to
talk about. Well, they don't understand why it isn't important, and there's no
way I can teach it to them. They have to learn it themselves.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: Many
times, I agree that you could ignore all the geology; many, many times the
geology is benign. That is, you have flat beds, you have low water content, you
have good porous rock. There is no nearby structure that would affect the
containment. And, a rock type where we have a good handle on the physical properties,
and they are well within the range that we are familiar with. And the water
content, the same thing; it's within a range that we know for this particular
lithologic unit that's being tested in. And that there's no large body of clay
at the working point.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: We've never seen a large body
of clay, except for the Baneberry site, have we?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: There was
the site for the Stutz event that had a pretty large volume of clay. I think
there has to be a particular set of circumstances to get a big pod of clay. On
Baneberry there was opportunity for a large amount of water moving through the formation,
and the right lithology that could alter, and a thick zone. You've got to have
water, and you've got to have a vitric tuff that will readily turn to clay, and
the right chemical conditions to start the process.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've seen that situation
twice. I don't think that any other time we have drilled into a situation like
that. Normally the clay we see is at the interface between two units, which is
stratigraphic, and very, very thin. Theoretically, in a long strike it could
get thicker, but not more than ten feet or so.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: On
Baneberry that clay was what, a few hundred feet thick?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: Yes. It
would be very nice if we could excavate that and see what it really looked
like. We've looked on outcrops and looked for situations like that. Where would
you go to look, to see if you could find a situation like that? There should be
an analogue at the surface somewhere. The closest we could find to something
like that was in what they call a chinle formation on the Colorado plateau. That
was essentially volcanic ash that was deposited in a shallow ocean or pond, and
altered. It's hundreds of feet thick. But we never have we seen anything like
that on the Test Site.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: With
data from the hundreds of drill holes that are on the Test Site you must be
able to plot everything everywhere, from hole to hole.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: Yes, we
have 2-D and 3-D programs where we can do that. We call up the data base and
plot the holes. That's how we do the siting. The program looks at a site and
plots the geology, the water table, the lithologic units, and plots in the
known faults, and their distance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Laboratory people
come in with a set of coordinates, and the parameters for the hole. We plug
that into the program and crank out what they call a prediction report. And
then we do the same thing with the gravity. We show what the configuration of the
Paleozoic surface will be, and send it on to the Labs. That eventually gets
incorporated into the prospectus and the presentation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes we reach a point
where we do not agree. Or we might point out certain problems, like a lava mass
being close to the site. We went through one of those in Area 20, where the two
exploratory holes drilled did confirm there was a blob out there. It turned out
that it wasn't really any problem, because it turned out</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">to be far enough away.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, as the hole
is drilled you develop more data. It's an ongoing process. Now, I think,
they've gone overboard, and collect data that nobody seems to understand.
Especially water content. We here still think something's fishy between the
results of the two water content logs - the epithermal neutron logs that Livermore
is showing these days, and the one they used to show.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Why?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: It has to
do with the bound water. It's hard to tell which standard to use, because the
Lab seems to pick the one that fits best. Which is okay, I guess, but that
really doesn't solve the problem of understanding why you have this bound water
and additional water. The water contents on Pahute are up what &ndash; ten percent
more? - than we ever used in the projections. On some of the recent shots where
they're using the new logs, the water contents are up in the twenty's -
twenty-five percent, twenty-four percent. Which might be real, but we really
don't know. This is one of the outgrowths of all the data gathering that's been
going on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: These
new numbers are coming from the neutron log aren't they?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Orkild</b>: Yes, and
I think it's a positive step. But I think it's going to take a lot more work
before they really understand it, and everybody agrees with it. Of course,
getting everybody to agree will probably never happen, but you could certainly
get to where a majority agreed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Fenske</b>: Hazelton
Nuclear Science Corporation got a contract to do hydrologic studies on the Test
Site in 1962. Hazelton had two labs for work with radioisotopes; a pretty high
level lab, and a low level one. They were doing all kinds of things for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and the National Institute of Health, and people like
that who were interested in radioactivity. They were hiring people, and in
about 1965 I went to work for them. The program was to find out whether
underground testing was going to contaminate ground water in such a way that it
would cause a serious problem. I don't recall what a “serious<i class="calibre13"> </i>problem"
would have been at that time, but I think it came out that it would be if any radioactivity
would leave the Test Site.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where was the water
going to go? Nobody really knew very much about the transport of radioactivity
in ground water, and not too much was known about hydrology, in that sense. At
that time hydrology was centered around how much water could be produced from a
well. So, hydrology was drilling a hole into an aquifer, and producing water so
you could water the livestock, or irrigate the field, or something like that.
That was the hydrology the USGS was steeped in at that time. It was always
drilling holes and finding out how much water could be produced.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do that, in the final
analysis what you really do is pump on the well. In a nice isotropic,
homogeneous medium the production is an exponentially decreasing curve. You
plot it on semi-log paper, and it's a straight line. When the line comes out so
many years in the future going to zero production, you know that's it - that's
the end of that well, probably. Of course that assumes things are isotropic and
homogeneous and all those nice things. Which they never are, but that's about
as good as you can do. The longer you run the pumping test the more confidence
you have in the results, but, as on some of the wells at the Test Site that the
USGS tested, you can find that the slope of the curve changes. It goes along nicely,
and all of a sudden it starts diving. It has what they call a boundary effect.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, hydrology was a
developing field, from the point of view of transport of water for a long
distance. It started out with the idea that there is an aquifer, there's a
gradient in the aquifer, and therefore the water is moving down the gradient at
a certain rate. Essentially you drill a couple of holes, and if the water comes
up to a certain level in one hole, and comes up to a lower level in another, you
figure there's a hydraulic gradient in that direction. Early on, people tried
to figure what the hydraulic gradient was, and what the direction was, and what
the permeability was so they could say, "This contamination is going to go
in that direction, and will travel this far in so many years."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As things progressed,
people realized that the hydrology in an area wasn't that simple. The Test Site
is not at all simple; it has a very complex hydrology, and we still don't know
much about it, really. And, radionuclides are adsorbed on rocks. Then we found out
that the process isn't really symmetrical; they weren't desorbed at the same
rate they were adsorbed, and things like that. All kinds of problems like that
occurred, but it didn't change the basic conclusion. That was, except for the
tritium, the radionuclides just weren't moving very much. At least that was so
for the rocks we were dealing with.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the carbonate
aquifers are different, because things like strontium and calcium are ionically
similar, and strontium will move in the carbonate aquifers. In the alluvium you
just didn't find any real movement of that material. In alluvium we never have
found movement, except for the tritium, which moves as fast as, or maybe faster
than the average velocity of the ground water.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: How
can something in the water move faster than the average velocity of the water?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Fenske</b>: Well, you
try to calculate the velocity of the water on the basis of the pore structure
and the permeability, which are the two things you have to have to get the
velocity of the water. That's an average value for the movement of the water in
the aquifer. Now, that aquifer extends over a broad region, and there may be localized
regions where the pore structure is different from the one you used to
calculate the average velocity. An old, buried stream bed, for example. If you
happen to drill into that when you are measuring the movement of the tritium,
you might find a faster velocity than you have calculated as an average. So,
it's not that easy. The velocity of diffusion depends on pore size, and the
pores can be of different sizes in different places, so it gets to be complex.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: One of the things I have heard
about the Test Site, which is said to be unusual, is that the water table is
very deep, that there are very few places where you will have to go down 1600
feet before you get to the water. Is that true?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Fenske</b>: Well, if
you're talking about Yucca Valley, yes. If you're talking about Pahute Mesa,
no. On Pahute the water is pretty far down, but very often in regions at higher
elevations you will find deeper water. In lower regions, like Yucca Valley, you
find shallower water. In fact, a lot of valleys in Nevada have swampy areas in
them. Ruby Marshes is a good example. Or they have springs; Hot Creek Valley
has springs. That would be the normal situation. But in Yucca Valley it's
different.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had one of the fellows
at DRI, a number of years ago, draw a map of the elevation of the water in all
of the valley bottoms in Nevada. The reason for this was because I felt if I
had the elevation of the water in all the valley bottoms I would have an idea
of what the regional flow structure looked like in Nevada. Well, you find everything
is very regular, and it all moves down towards Death Valley - until it hits the
Test Site, where Yucca Valley is. Then, there are very steep gradients going
into Yucca Valley. There's something else going on; Yucca Valley is underlain
in many areas by the carbonate rocks, which are fractured, and transmissive of
water.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing you have
in Yucca is that the alluvium has a higher water saturation, higher in the
section, than you would expect in a dry valley. All the way to the surface you
have some water saturations that are higher than you normally would expect. In
some places you find 20, 30, 40 percent water saturations; much higher than you
would expect to see if the water was always down at the level where it is now.
The impression you get is that at one time the water was up near the surface,
but now it isn't any more.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I think has
happened is that the carbonates which underlie the valley have acted as a huge
drain. So, the water is basically moving down to the carbonate, and out to the
springs in Amargossa. The water in all the rest of the Nevada area is moving in
sort of a normal fashion; in Yucca it's being drained, and has been drained, so
it's not up near the surface anymore. It's down closer to the level of the
water in the Amargossa.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you look at the
vertical gradients in the carbonate, they are much less than the vertical
gradients in the alluvium, so the normal direction of movement would be
downward through the alluvium into the carbonates in the Yucca valley. Then the
water moves south through Frenchman out to the springs in the Amargossa Desert.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the water
beneath Pahute may be draining into Yucca, but whether it is or not is the
subject of some argument. The Survey, which has done most of the work on that,
think that the Eleana formation, which comes along the side of Yucca Valley, on
the east side of Pahute, is a pretty effective barrier to movement into Yucca Flat.
Everything that comes off the west side of Pahute Mesa goes down underneath
Forty Mile Canyon toward Lathrop Wells. So, not much of any water gets into
Yucca from Pahute. Some probably does, but I think it would be small.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think there's
any recharge at all in Yucca. We ran an investigation there once where we
looked at tritium in the dirt. It's pretty dry dirt, and it's pretty hard to
dig it. I guess about the farthest they could reach was about as far as you
could reach with your hand to grab a handful of dirt. We found that the amount
of tritium pretty well decreased with depth, so there doesn't appear to have
been any recent recharge there. By the time you got down about a meter you just
didn't find any tritium any more, in the dirt. There was a lot of tritium in
the rain in the sixties from the atmospheric tests; there was a peak during
those years. You don't find that at depth when you look at it in Yucca valley,
or on the slopes around the valley. So, I don't think there's much recharge going
on there. I don't think it's going from the surface of the valley down 2000
feet.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, it may reach an
equilibrium point where the gradient around the sides of the valley is
increased enough to replenish the water about as fast as it's running out.
There are steep gradients going down into the valley, and the lower you make
the water, the steeper those gradients get, and the more water you bring into
the valley from the sides. It may have reached an equilibrium point, but I
don't know if it has or not. You'd have to watch for a long time, a hundred
years, or two hundred years, to be able to tell.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: A few
years ago, in the LAN L area, radioactivity was found when they were drilling
an emplacement hole. There was the thought that perhaps this activity had been
transported from the expended Sandreef or Aleman sites, to the north. If that
was so, it had traveled laterally a lot further than people had expected. What do
you think accounted for the transport that was observed? It did happen.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Fenske</b>: Yes, it
did. There are a lot of things we can't explain that we see once in a while.
The only thing I can think is that there was pressure in the cavity, and
material was driven down a fracture that momentarily opened up. As I recall,
there were some radionuclides out there that had gaseous precursors, and they wouldn't
have gotten that far if they hadn't been shoved over by a pulse of gas, or
something like that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, the water above
the carbonates, in the alluvium and the tuffs, drains down. It is when it gets
into the common aquifer that it drains to the south. I would think that the
amount of lateral transport, above the carbonates, is pretty small. That
doesn't mean there can't be some, but I think it's pretty small.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: On another
subject, what is perched water?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Fenske</b>: Well,
it's something that you may well have in Yucca valley, if once you had a higher
water table and now you have a lower water table. Say that a thousand years ago
you had a water table close to the surface. If that water table drops, there
will be water left in various places - on top of layers of less permeable material,
for instance. That water is just sitting up there - perched up there. It is not
like a lake; it's just a more saturated region of the rocks.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the conventional
sense of perched water, you'd be in a more humid region than the NTS, and you'd
have a water table at some level. The water that's deposited on the surface
infiltrates down. But, there may be some fairly shallow little clay lenses. So,
some of that water sits on top of these clay lenses. Then it runs off the edges,
and down to the water table, but there's a time delay. In that situation, given
a certain amount of rainfall on the average, there's always a lens of water
that's perched up there on top of this clay lens. It's in equilibration between
the amount of water that's running off the edges of the lens, and the amount of
rainfall that deposited.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>:
Perched water was one of the things that was discussed in the first report
about what happened on Baneberry. The impression was given that the explosion
cracked a rock layer, and a lot of water ran into the cavity. In the situation
you describe, that couldn't happen .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Fenske</b>: No, it
couldn't. At least not rapidly, not in minutes. It might do it in months, or
years, or decades, or something like that, depending on the permeabilities of
the materials.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: What
about “water mounds," that are thought to be produced by nuclear
detonations?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Fenske</b>: You will
get Fenske's version, which is that I don't really believe in water mounds. I
do believe in potential mounds. What I mean by that is, in material which has a
low permeability, such as the alluvium, the water maybe moves ten feet a year
when it's moving laterally. I don't think that, instantaneously, you can move
huge volumes of water up meters in height over big areas. I think that what
happens is that the relationship between grain pressure and pore pressure is
changed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say you drill a hole
down into the formation, and measure the water level. After the shot you have a
higher pore pressure there than you had before; so the water comes up to
equalize that pore pressure. And so, every place you drill a hole you have
water coming up to higher levels than it did before the shot. You can say you
have a water mound there, but it's not the water that's a mound - it's a
potential mound. What you are really measuring is the potential of water in
that formation at that point. Now, the water's flowing, because of the
gradients and the higher potentials, from one place to another. But it's not a
real mound of water. The holes you are drilling are really acting as
piezometers; they're measuring the water pressure at that point, which is
higher than you would consider at that depth, or higher than it was before.
There really isn't any more water there than there was before. It's just that
the pressure, in the water, is higher than it was before the shot, so the water
just comes up higher in the piezometer tube that you have put in there. And
that's because, in shaking the ground, you have transferred the grain pressure
to pore pressure.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The material is
originally in an equilibrium situation, where all the sand grains are impinging
on one another, and they hold the pores open to a certain degree. If you took
'all the water out, there would still be some pores in there. Now, if you shift
the sand grains a little bit, they can go together and reduce the porosity.
Then, because you have reduced the porosity, there isn't the space for the water
that there was before, but there's still the pressure of the overlying rocks.
By reducing the porosity you have increased the pore pressure, or the water
pressure in the rocks.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same thing happens, incidentally,
in a landslide. You have a water saturated material. A little shift of the
grains, for one reason or another, will start increasing the pore pressure, and
decreasing the grain pressure. When you do that you decrease the resistance to
flow; the material becomes liquefied, and downhill it goes. Spontaneous
liquefaction is basically that kind of a mechanism. You've been to the beach
and patted the sands?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Sure.
And water comes up to the top.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Fenske</b>: Yes.
You're compacting the sand, and the water comes up. When you compact it, that
material becomes <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="calibre_link-75">liquefied</a>; it becomes mushy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you start calculating
the amount of water that would have to be in a water mound, given a reasonable
porosity, and how much you had to move in a fairly short period of time, that's
a lot of water. And then you have to ask, "Where did it come from?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have run into
situations where perched water was a consideration, and it has caused all kinds
of problems. They were not necessarily containment problems; they were problems
with emplacing the device, just getting the thing down in the hole. For example,
there have been cases where the Labs have put down a liner, and the water has
come over the top of the liner. That has to do with hydrology, and you ought to
understand more about it. Sometimes that's a perched water problem.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: No
it's not. It's a stupidity problem. They say, "And the water level was
tagged at 636 meters. So, we've put in a liner whose top is at 636.5
meters." They seem to think that all they need is a liner that is an inch,
or a foot higher than their tag, and everything will be swell. And then they
say, "Oh my gosh, the water is running over the top. How
distressing." What I think is, "How expensive to fix. Fire
them."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Fenske</b>: Well,
there are other cases where water has run over the top for other reasons. There
is the possibility that there really is perched water. When you go through a
zone where there is water, and it's not all necessarily held in by capillarity,
it can run out. And there are cases where there is excess pressure in the
water, as in the ground water mound. There was one shot where the water
pressure was high enough to collapse the casing, due to ground water mounding,
or the pressure in the water, as I think of it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: So,
suppose I am drilling down through the alluvium, and the tuffs, and it's dry. I
am careful to stay above the standing water level, but I notice water running
into the hole. As I understand it, that could happen because there's perched
water, or as you would say it, there's a high pressure zone. If I case that hole,
the casing has to be able to withstand a pressure that is at least equal to
whatever the pore pressure of that water is. If it can't do that, it could
collapse, even though that casing is above the standing water level.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Fenske</b>: Yes.
There's another way you could have perched water, and at the Test Site it would
be water running into the valley. If you happen to have a tongue of something
like clay, that's lower permeability, which extends into the Valley, water may
run along the top of it rather than run down to the water table. It may run along
the top, and then drip over the edge. Up to that point you may have perched
water. Around the valley sides, more than around the center, you could possibly
have perched water. You have a source that keeps on running, because it's
recharge water from, let's say, Pahute Mesa that's coming through the system.
It's just taking a little different path. A good example of that is some of the
springs that you see. They're basically perched water. Water enters the system,
flows down some impermeable layer, and comes out in the form of a spring where
the layer intersects the surface.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Carothers</b>: Do you
think we've made any difference to the flow of the water, or the drainage of
the water? Have we upset the hydrology of the valley?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b class="calibre15">Fenske</b>: I don't
think so, except locally. around the cavity, and for some small distance out
from that. I looked at one thing though, at one time, which was the number of
un cased bore holes that went into the Paleozoics. There turned out to be a
fairly large number. At some level those holes enhance the flow of water from
the alluvium down into the carbonates. Of course, you have to start with how
much water is leaking through there, without the holes, to see what that
enhancement might be, and we don't know that.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6: Earth Materials and Their Properties</h2>
<br>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The geologic materials in which a
device is detonated determine the details of the phenomenology that occurs.
Hence, the properties of these materials are required as input for any of the codes
used to calculate the expected cavity size, hydro fractures that may occur, the
various stresses that occur, the ground motions, and so on. Unfortunately, many
difficulties beset the determination of these properties.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In emplacement holes there is no
access to the materials, or to information about the geologic materials around
the shot point, other than that provided by logging tools, or various tools
which can retrieve small samples. In the tunnels samples can be taken fairly readily,
and laboratory measurements can be made on them to determine various quantities
such as density, porosity, and water content. However, such laboratory
measurements cover only a small range of the conditions the material is
subjected to near the detonation, and tell nothing of how the material will
respond to a shock pressure of 500 kilobars, for example, or to simultaneous radial
and tangential stresses.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laboratory measurements are made
on small, competent samples of rock, while the energy of the detonation
interacts with the entire mass of the surrounding earth, which can include
fractures, faults, and layers of different materials of different composition and
properties. The behavior of the overall surrounding materials may be quite
different from what would be expected from the properties of a small laboratory
sample.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocks that have been subjected to
the high shock pressures generated by the energy released in the detonation can
be damaged, to various degrees, depending on the shock pressure, and their properties
are not the same after the shock wave has passed as they were before.
Therefore, they do not respond as they did before, but things important to
containment are still occurring.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not agreement among
those working in the field of containment as to what the properties important
to containment are.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Los Alamos had drilled some
holes during the moratorium, and after the resumption of testing in 1961 that activity
picked up considerably. What sort of logging did you do, or what kind of
geologic information did you look for? Or did it just accumulate peripherally
to the actual drilling?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, I hate to go on record as
saying this, but when I was dealing with the engineers those kinds of questions
had nothing to do with it at all. They picked the sites, and told us there was
a hole there. We could ask whatever questions we chose about it, but they were
not obligated to tell us anything. The truth is, they didn't know anything
about the site.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: If you asked, "What are
the rocks like at the bottom of the hole?" Or "What sort of layers of
rock have you drilled through?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: No answer. Now, they very well
may have had some information, but they certainly didn't feel obligated to
share it with a non-engineer. The one fact they acknowledged was that it was
possible to hit water. And so, I usually knew if we had gotten to the water
table.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew the depth, of
course. And if they were in tuff, they would tell me that as opposed to being
in alluvium. But I didn't know much about tuff, because the alluvium in Area 3
is very deep. So, tuff was not a common kind of occurrence until we got toward the
edge of the valley.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But logging was not a
requirement. The only requirement was to drill a straight hole, and so they did
a lot of worrying about not drilling crooked holes. All the emphasis was on the
mechanics, on the engineering aspects of the drilling. That's the way I
remember it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally derived
four standard materials, based on how close I was to the water table. I had
very dry, dry, wet and very wet. The very dry was for the top of the alluvium
in Area 3, and the very wet was at the water table. And, I had a couple of
other standard curves. So, I found that the equations of state were some
strange function of depth, but it wasn't depth from the surface, it was really
distance from the water table.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the question I
would ask was, "Where is the water table?" And Rae Blossom would fume
and say, "You don't have to know that. There's no reason why we should
spend a dollar to find out where the water table is. Just knock it off. What
difference does it make to you anyway? We tagged the water table at such and
such a depth over there, so that is what it is. How could it be any different here?"
And so, my questions always ended in big arguments about non-relevant things
like budgets, and time, and money, and "You're bothering the engineers.
Get the hell out of here."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd go have these
terrible arguments with Rae, and shout and wave my arms, and we were enemies
forever, and then Rae would go out and get the answer to my question because he
would recognize I really was serious. You see, if you didn't persevere, you weren't
serious. But if you persevered, he'd go get the information you wanted. So, I
have to admit that on a number of occasions Rae did make an attempt to get
answers to some of my questions. He was in a position where he could order the
rest of them to do it, but it was always like pulling teeth to get that done.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I'm afraid that
in those very earliest times we knew next to nothing about the medium or its
properties after the hole was drilled. The guys who drilled would record that
the drilling rate changed, but you didn't know why. I only found out about some
of these things when we were actually doing the tests. Livermore did a better
job than we, because when they were doing the tunnels they were asking the
right kinds of questions. I did get permission to go out and see what was
there, and I was educated more by Livermore guys than by people here, in the
very earliest times.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Pre-Baneberry there was,
apparently, no real requirement at Los Alamos to take logs and samples.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scolman</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I don't recall that there was.
My feeling is that to the extent that there was logging done, or we studied the
lithology of the hole, it had to do mostly with drilling. How do you best drill
it? Anything that came out in terms of geologic information was almost
incidental to that procedure. We did run some logs. We ran caliper logs, for
example.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Because you wanted to put the
casing down the hole, and you wanted to know how much cement you would need.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scolman</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Exactly. Because you had to put
the casing down, and, of course, we ran cement logs, so we could say, “Yes, it
is cemented." We calculated how much cement we should have put in and then
made sure that it was reasonable with regard to that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What attention did the
Livermore people pay to the medium the event was in?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olsen</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That really didn't come until
Baneberry. There were some of us in the containment group, in '69 and '70, who
started to appreciate some things. In particular, what we looked at was C02
content, because there was a shot that conventional wisdom said, at that time,
was deep enough, and had enough yield that it shouldn't have leaked, but it
did. That was Nash. Well, the obvious thing about Nash was that it was in high
carbonate rock. As soon as you think about it, if you make a lot of C02, it
doesn't go away, so it just keeps pushing. So, one of the things we started
thinking about early, when there came some sensitivity about seeping, was carbonate
content. We didn't go much beyond that, although we started to, until
Baneberry.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Was there any logging or
sampling program to look at the various media you might be shooting in?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olsen</span></b><span class="calibre10">: We did some. It was not much. I
don't remember that we did downhole sampling. We took cutting samples, as they drilled.
One of the problems, in that era, was that there were not big-hole logging
tools, which are now the standard. If you wanted to do any geophysical logging
you had to drill a small diameter hole, so there was a lot more exploratory
drilling then than there is now. We did take cores, and we had, basically, oil
field geophysical tools to measure density and things like that. So, we had
some logs then, and there were a few people who were beginning to look at those
things. The cratering people, who were still in business at the time, were
interested in knowing densities and things like that as input to their
computational models, but they weren't interested in containment, obviously, if
they were interested in blowing a crater.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to determine something
about the material properties in the emplacement holes is to obtain samples of
the rocks at various depths, and to do various tests on them, in the
laboratory. Such samples mayor may not be representative of the actual
material, but they are a start. Obtaining such samples is not an easy, nor inexpensive
matter, as the drillers see it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: One thing I'd like to tell you
is about all the sampling deals that came up after Baneberry. I was thinking
about that when you called and said you would like to talk with me. I thought,
"I wonder if he ever heard some of my tirades about all the sampling we
did, back then."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: All the sampling? Just those
few little side-wall samples here and there, you mean?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yeah, just a few. In fact I
wrote a technical paper on it. It was years ago when they were designing the
tool to go out and take a side wall core, not a side wall sample. I said,
"You've got to find a way of getting this information with logs." And
they finally did. I was happy about that, because they caused us so many problems
with that sampling. Drilling the hole is difficult enough.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preshot measurements of material
properties are important in the prediction of the behavior of the surrounding
medium when the shot occurs. Measurements on cores and samples taken after the drilling
of a hole, and downhole logging data from emplacement holes provide some
information. However, there is not uniform agreement as to the value, or
necessity, of the various kinds of data that can, or should be obtained.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Bill, you chaired a committee
to look at various material properties to make recommendations about which ones
were important, or how they should be measured.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenhofel</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It goes back to Baneberry, when
the properties of the medium had a contributory effect in the release. So the
system said, "We've got to have some way to find out what's down there. And
we want to have that in numbers, we want to quantify it."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were certain
measurements that could be made at that time. You could get samples, and you
could measure the water, the grain density, the bulk density from either
samples or from logging tools, and you could measure the carbon dioxide. Those
measurements are relatively easy to make. They're cheap, they're routine, and
they tell you something about the material down there. Then you can calculate
other properties, some of which may be related to containment, like gas-filled
porosity. You can do that, and it's cheap, so you do that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a committee
set up at that time, and then there was a report that said, "We are now
going to collect these data, and make these measurements. At the very least, if
there are any more surprises which are likely to cause another Baneberry, these
measurements will probably tell us about those surprises."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You make it sound as though the
measurement of material properties started along the lines of, "Well,
we've got to do something. Here are some things we can do, so let's do
those."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenhofel</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Pretty close. That's the
impression I'm trying to give. And that wasn't foolish. We were scared. And
there was another thingi the physicists liked it, because they had numbers now.
And again I'm being a little facetious, but not completely.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, Bill, what is a physicist
going to do with information like, "At 1326 feet there are fossilized tree
trunks mixed with gravel and sand." How do you put that into a code to calculate
anything?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenhofel</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I know. I realize that. But
anyway, that's how it got started. Then the next thing that happened was that
some years ago you appointed a Data Needs Subcommittee for the Panel, and I was
the Chairman.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, there had been a certain
amount of grumbling, among some Panel members, who would occasionally say, "Why
are you showing me all this?" And then there was grumbling on the part of
other people who said, "I think it's absurd that you show me data that
shows a water content of 100% and a saturation of 120%. How can there be 120%
saturation? That just tells me you don't know what you're doing. Why are you
doing this?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenhofel</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes. So, that subcommittee was
appointed, and it's purpose was to look at what data was' being collected to
see whether there was additional data that ought to be collected, or whether we
could stop collecting some of it. Well, we expanded that charter a little bit
to include, "What kind of data ought to be presented to the CEP." One
of our recommendations was that we add a section on phenomenology, and a
section on a discussion of the containment aspects of the event. So, I think we
made a pretty good contribution .in terms of what data ought the CEP see, and
what ought to be in a containment package.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my personal
opinion, I think we badly goofed when we failed to eliminate much of the data
we're collecting on material properties. We failed to do that. I tried, and
some other members of the Panel tried, to get some of that data eliminated, and
the Labs would not stand still for it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What, for example, do you think
are some things that don't need to be collected?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenhofel</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Grain-density. Bulk density.
And consequent calculations based on them. I just don't think they are directly
relevant to containment. I think that those data do not need to be collected.
I've always thought that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I think that the
electrical log is a really valuable tool because it tells you something about
whether the rock is different from the norm, whatever the norm is. There's a
norm for alluvium, and there's norm for tuff. If there's something different,
when the electric log tells you that then you can go and look at the samples very
carefully and see whether there is a bunch of clay or not, for example.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we know
enough now about Yucca Flat and Pahute Mesa that we can drill a hole, take a
few simple logs, and treat those areas just like the Sandpile. In certain
places along the edges of the valley there may be another Baneberry surprise,
but we'd catch it with simple logging. Then we could go into it in detail. This
concept didn't prevail in the Data Needs Subcommittee because of the opposition
of the Labs.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What sort of arguments did the
Labs make? You'd think they would latch onto that and say, “Here’s our chance
to save a few bucks."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenhofel</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, they didn't. I think
there were two reasons. If you have numbers, and you have data, that gives you
some appearance of having done a good job. You've gone to the best of your
capabilities. Also, the calculators do like to have some of those numbers. I'm
not trying to downgrade their attitude at all; they had a good attitude. It
just differed a little bit from mine. I think it's time to reopen the whole question
of what's needed, and to look at it again.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Which properties do you think
do matter to containment?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenhofel</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You ought to know the carbonate
content. You don't have to know it precisely, but you ought to know if it gets
over six or seven percent. I think you ought to know if there are some big
acoustic interfaces. The Paleozoic location is only of concern because it's an
acoustic interface. I don't see any reason to give water content, I really
don't, unless you want to know it for coupling, and placement of instruments.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more thing about
physical properties, or material properties. I think the histograms that are
presented are probably unnecessary. We now have such a wealth of experience,
since Baneberry, with all those grain densities, water content, gas-filled porosity,
and all that, that what we say is, “Well, they're within experience. They're
within successful experience, every property." Well, of course they are.
We've covered a span now from 5% water to 27% water, so any value we get is
going to fall within our successful experience. We're deluding ourselves with
the magic of these numbers and the histograms, in thinking that they are
relevant to anything. Again, I'm making an extreme statement to make a point.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Or, I could put it as, “We’ve shot
in just about every kind of geologic medium there is at the Test Site, and so
the material properties of a new site are almost sure to fall in the range
you've observed before."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenhofel</span></b><span class="calibre10">: And many of them don't matter.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As contrasted to the measurement
of the material properties preshot, either in-situ or in the laboratory,
measurements can be attempted of the response of the material to the shock
pressures and motions produced by the detonation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There was a program at Sandia
that was beginning to get started during the moratorium. Luke Vortman, Lou
Perret, and Al Chabai had a very nice program set up. They asked me if I would be
willing to go to work with AI Chabai on this, as his assistant. I said, “Sure,”
and I got involved with Hugoniot determinations for earth materials. The main
thing we were going to do was write a report on close-in effects of buried
underground explosions, be they nuclear or chemical made no difference. We
wanted to look at the pressures generated close by, the temperatures generated,
whatever was there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Livermore was heavily
involved in this kind of work through the PNE program. Dave Lombard was doing
this at Livermore. He was doing a lot of very good Hugoniot work. Bob McQueen
was doing it at Los Alamos, and AI Chabai and I were doing it at Sandia. We
said, “Let's measure Hugoniots, let's measure elastic waves. Let's look at
granite, let's look at alluvium." Nobody wanted to look at alluvium very
much. We looked at tuff a little bit; nobody really wanted to look at tuff. We
were much more interested in oil shales, sandstones, and things like that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, we got going
on it. We did explosive work out at Coyote Canyon, behind Manzano. We had an
explosive site out there that I was in charge of, and I had a crew of about
eight or ten. It wasn't a big facility; it was sort of an ad hoc thing that we
put together. So we started doing this, and we were chugging along merrily,
measuring shock velocities and things like that. Mainly we were doing Hugoniot
work, and gauge development.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What shock pressures were you
trying to reach?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass</span></b><span class="calibre10">: My job was to get as high as we
could. We wanted to get to a megabar. At that time Altschuler's work was coming
out, and Altschuler was getting up toward a megabar. Everybody said, “How in
the world is he doing it?" The answer was obvious to us all what he was
doing, but it was never in the literature. It has been finally admitted he was
using nuclear sources. He was ahead of everybody, there's no question about
that. He did some great work, and I think he's still around and still doing
some pretty good work. McQueen had started doing some flyer plate work at Los
Alamos, where he was getting up towards a megabar.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's no problem at
all to get to a couple of megabars in brass, or steels, or maybe even aluminum.
Getting a geologic material up there is a little tougher, because its impedance
is so much lower. We did the best we could; we would run flyer plates five or
six inches, and planarity was going to hell on us; we were generally using
eight inch flyer plates as plane wave generators. We evacuated the path between
the flyer plate and the target, trying to cut down on the air shock that would
build up and screw up our instrumentation. So we would fire the things in a
vacuum. We would have to glue the plates to the explosive to keep them from
bowing away when we pumped them down. It wasn't a very good vacuum, but you
certainly could bow an eight inch plate; eighty mils was a typical thickness
for the flyer plates. We followed Mcqueen's work on this directly. I'd say we
were getting up to a megabar. The other high pressure work that was being done
was being done by Bill Isbell, at General Motors at the time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The results of the Livermore
work on Rainier, and that work was very much focused just on Rainier, caused us
to modify our experimental measurements program. We had three or four people who
were spending a lot of time on designing measurement techniques for the
megabar, or many hundreds of kilobars, pressure regime, and we dropped all of
those except one confirmatory measurement that was done on the Antler
experiment in 1961 . That was done by Dave Lombard, and it is the only megabar
level active measurement that's been done on a shot.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can remember
standing up at a meeting at Rand Corporation, in Santa Monica, and making an
impassioned plea. “Please stop spending all this money on ten megabar equations
of state because it doesn't make a bit of difference. It's all electrons
anyway." And I wasn't the only one making that argument. That point of
view prevailed, and so all that work stopped. And that was wrong. It was a
terrible mistake.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: And you talked them into it?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, I was one of those who
did. I've thought of things I've done wrong, and that was certainly one of
them. The consequence of that decision was that the measurements program centered
on the things like Bob Bass has done for the last thirty years, measuring
stress levels in the tens to low hundred kilobar range, where plastic failure,
and brittle failure, and that kind of thing is happening. Of course, that
region is important not only for containment purposes; it's important for
structures effects purposes. It's a region where the mechanical engineers are
very uncomfortable designing things like bunkers, and missile silos, and very
crucial elements of an offensive or defensive system. Whether the stresses come
from nuclear or not nuclear things, that stress region is important. So, it
wasn't totally a mistake, but it was a mistake from the standpoint that we
would today understand more about what goes on in the explosion than we do .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I did not go to that meeting in
Santa Monica. I was in Rio that week, and if I had a choice, I would be in Rio
de Janiero. I would say that where Gary now feels we are lacking is not necessarily
in the megabar region, but in the hundred kilobar, two hundred kilobar regime.
That's because the phase changes that are going on in all of our native
materials have been terribly handled theoretically. The various contractors who
have worked with that have really botched that job badly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you get into a
porous geologic material, apparently the phase change can move down in
pressure, down into the seventy or eighty kilo bar region, because of the
temperature that's involved. Alluvium does funny things. Alluvium starts
expanding when you get above a hundred kilobars when you hit it. On a Hugoniot
plot of pressure versus volume, it starts expanding when you get up there,
because you're moving back in the temperature curve. It's a mess, and I don't
pretend to really understand what's happening there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be nice to
have data in the megabar region, but I'd rather have them in the hundred kilo
bar regime. Shell Schuster, who used to be at Livermore said, “Don’t measure me
another Hugoniot, for God's sake. I can draw them." And I think he's
right. You can draw the Hugoniot, but you can't write the equation of state.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we've got a
better handle on some of these things than a lot of people realize. There have
been two decent sources of data in recent years. The containment program has
provided a wealth of data. Frankly, I think most of it recently has come from
DNA, and Sandia. I think that's because of where they test. The DNA tunnel events
give you the opportunity to make a decent measurement, because you can get
there. You know exactly where your gauge is, you know exactly where it's
pointing, you can orient it with a transit. You don't have to dangle it down a
hole, or put it in a satellite hole.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other great
source of data has been the hydrodynamic yield program, and this a tremendously
overlooked source of data. We got seventy-five pressure measurements in tuffs
and alluviums in the period when Los Alamos was making hydrodynamic yield measurements.
Individually they're pretty damn bad, but as a whole they're pretty good.
There's a wealth of data in there in the 500 kilobar to 10 kilobar pressure
regime. There are awfully good data on events in alluvium up to 500 kilobars. I
know they're good because I made the measurements, and I'm very happy with
them. They were not measurements of wave shape, however. They were measures of
peak pressure, and at 500 kilobars what else can you have?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another batch of data
came from Livermore. Clyde Seismore came up with a marvelous pressure gauge
that worked in this pressure regime. It was a bulb of plexiglass; it turns out
that when you shock plexiglass it puts out a charge. So, Clyde put this bulb of
plexiglass downhole, and he made some outstanding measurements.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;App</span></b><span class="calibre10">: DNA has the best opportunity to
look at material properties in-situ, and at what material damage has been
caused by the shot because they can go into the tunnels preshot, and can reenter
after the shot. On a reentry they can go back in and obtain core samples of
rock that has been shocked to a kilobar, or five kilobars. They can obtain the
damaged samples, send them to Terra Tek and have them measure the residual
strength.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: And it's different from the
strength of rock that hasn't been shocked.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;App</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes it is. For the cases I have
seen on reentry, the tuff appears to damage more than the grout. Preshot, both
the rock and the grout give off a ringing sound when hit by a rock hammer.
Postshot, the grout still rings, but the tuff gives off a dull thud. The
postshot tuff can be pulled from the walls by hand, and it crumbles.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DNA has taken cores
from damaged rock to Terra Tek, and the failure properties they measure are
way, way down. Of course, it's a function of range. At five kilobars the damage
is severe, at one kilobar it is just beginning, and at five hundred bars it is
virtually nonexistent. Damage decreases significantly with increasing range.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a practical
matter, on the vertical shots we can't obtain such core, so we have to estimate
damage based on the tunnel rock observations. Or we can try to pseudo-damage
rocks in the laboratory them by straining them, and determine how they weaken with
strain. You can do that up to a point, but you can't get the really large,
twenty percent type shear strains that occur in an underground test. And, you
can't replicate the strain rates either. So, we're not really replicating what
is going on in the ground with laboratory tests.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with
laboratory tests we can get some feeling whether a material is going to damage
easily or not. DNA has gone to a lot of effort to try to simulate damage in the
lab, but with a lab sample, once you get a through-going shear failure, you've
lost your experiment. They can't achieve twenty percent strains, although the
people at Waterways and Terra Tek are trying. They're coming up with new
schemes, and who knows? They might be successful; it would be very valuable to
the calculational community if they were.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Suppose you get a sample from a
tunnel location, and you send it to Terra Tek. They say its compressive
strength is such and so. There are folks who would say, "That's the value
for a small, competent piece of material. The region the device energy is
interacting with is much larger, and that much larger volume will have things
in it like fractures, changes in porosity, and so on. Therefore the lab
measurements are not really representative of the world the device energy is
going to interact with."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;App</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's right. But, for certain
types of rocks apparently that measurement is fairly representative. The Tunnel
Beds tuff in the tunnels is perhaps one of those rock types. The DNA modelers feel
that the in-situ fractures don't modify the overall properties much from what
one obtains from the small samples. The reason they believe this is that they
can put the Terra Tek test results into their models, and replicate the
outgoing shock wave fairly well. Now, I said outgoing shock wave; late time
residual stress is a different story.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other rock types such
as alluvium and welded tuff also are a different story. For these materials,
what you're saying is absolutely right. You cannot go from the laboratory
measurements to a calculation that agrees with the field data. This is a big
problem for us, and the approach we have taken is to start a systematic study
of events that have had a lot of free field measurements associated with them,
and inferthe response properties of the rock mass from them. Merlin alluvium is
an example. The Merlin event was heavily instrumented by Sandia. There were a
lot of working point level gauges, some horizontally out, and some vertically
up from the working point. Unfortunately, the Merlin samples are the only ones recovered
for alluvium core properties measurements, so that's the only case where we can
make direct comparison to the calculations.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're trying to
create a library of properties based on inferences made from modeling, as
opposed to from core. I don't know what else to do. This approach does take
into account the larger volume. Exactly what you've said is what prompted us to
take this course of action. We do not get a unique solution from these calculations,
but the more measurements we have, the closer to unique it becomes. So, we now
have a standard equation of state for Area 3 alluvium. It's not based on
mechanical measurements, because you can't obtain core in alluvium. If you do
get core it's only the more competent parts of the material, so it comes back
to your argument that it's not representative.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is
representative is what we see in the wave forms, and if we can infer properties
by using forward modeling techniques, then we can come up with an equation of
state for Area 3 alluvium. When we have our next shot in Area 3 we will take
those properties from Merlin, look at the comparisons of the physical
properties, such as density, and perhaps make a few adjustments, but keep the same
basic response model. Then we will use that in the new location where we're
trying to do a site evaluation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're currently
taking this approach with granite, for the verification program. We have the
same problem for verification. And so,<i class="calibre13"> </i>we're trying systematically to
calculate a number of events. We've been doing this for years now, as time
permits. It is not something we have recently started. There are three of us
working on this; myself, Wendee Brunish, and Jim Camm. We've calculated some
Pahute Mesa tests, and in Yucca Flat we've done a lot of work on the Hearts
event.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I would think that Pahute Mesa
would be your most difficult area. On Pahute you have fairly soft layers of
ashfall or ash flow rocks, and you have pillow of lavas, so you have hard
layers and soft layers. All of those presumably interact with the outgoing wave.
How do you handle that?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;App</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It's a difficult problem, and
we're not happy with our Pahute Mesa results in comparison with the
experimental data. We've been able to model certain aspects of them; we're able
to see the same kind of rarefactions, in the model, coming back from the hard
to soft transitions that we see in the measurements. But they are only
qualitatively similar. Quantitatively, no. I said something about uniqueness
earlier. When you have a layered situation, it is extremely difficult. From the
modeling standpoint what we'd really like to be able to find is a Pahute Mesa
site that doesn't have any soft layers, but then we'd be afraid to conduct the
event, from a containment standpoint, because the site would be different from any
we've used before.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When we talk about differences
in the materials, over what physical dimension do things have to be different
to produce changes in the response?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;App</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The size of the feature
compared to the wavelength is probably the most relevant thing. If a feature
that is different is quite small compared to the wavelength, it may not be very
important. This is not always true, however. It would not take a very large
open fracture to seriously attenuate the signal. The wavelength is going to
increase with increasing distance, so by the time you get out to where the wave
becomes elastic, it's going to take a fairly large feature to cause a serious
perturbation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Let's consider closer to the
device. There is the thought that it doesn't matter much what's close to the
device, because the energy release is so large that it just overwhelms any minor
geologic features. Some folks think that's not a very good argument.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;App</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I'm not one of those people.
Close in, in the true shock regime where the wave is supersonic, I don't think
response properties of the solid rock much matter. For rock that is vaporized, it
does make a difference. Now, again, these opinions are based on modeling. I
think properties do matter beyond where the eventual edge of the cavity will
be, at the few kilobar level and below. The exact range would be somewhat
material dependent.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two and three
dimensional effects are important, but our serious difficulties lie with
material response.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: But that's something you cannot
find out in the laboratory with the tests that you can make today.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;App</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You're right. Not to the degree
that we need to. I think we need more measurements in the field, and from that
data, backing out the response models would be the way we would go. These would
be inferred properties, and once again, there is a uniqueness problem. But, if
you get enough data, using reasonable assumptions about how a material behaves,
augmented by mechanical tests in the laboratory, you might be able to back out
how particular classes of materials behave.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That takes an
experimental program, and in fact that is part of the emphasis right now in
verification, to do more well controlled in-situ experiments. Modeling plays an
important role in the experimental setup. In order to maximize our ability to
infer bulk response properties of the rock, instruments must be located well into
the inelastic zone, and at numerous locations.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To characterize
various classes of rock in this way will be an expensive process, but once
having developed a library of properties, we should have more confidence in
modeling, and understanding the more important effects of layering, such as
exists at Pahute Mesa. Currently it is very difficult to sort out the effects
of layering.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pahute Mesa event
named Houston was a rare example of a site where there's considerable thickness
of hard rock without softer interlayered rock. The soft layers are halfway up
the hole. If we can have another shot in that area, where we can get
instrumentation strings deep, and study the propagation of the initial outgoing
wave, then we can learn something about the properties of a heretofore
difficult material to characterize.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Carl, when you make the
measurements you're making, I'm sure you must need to know properties of the
materials. Where do you get that information?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith</span></b><span class="calibre10">: DNA sends cores to Terra Tek
principally, where they are squeezed. The data from that goes principally to
Pac Tech, where Dan Patch does most of the stemming calculations for DNA. The
other big source of information is Maggie Baldwin and the people at DNA,
because they're the ones who have done the exploratory geophysics work in those
holes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Carl you have said, when
talking about the equation of state work, that measurements in the field are
not necessarily at all like those made in the laboratory on samples. Couldn't
the same criticism be made of the data from the cores?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It's a question of economics.
With a fixed pot of dollars you could spend it all on investigating one little
area, and know more and more about less and less until you know everything
about nothing. Or you could take that fixed pot of dollars and explore a larger
area with selected measurements. This question has always been a bugaboo for
DNA; you've got all these variations on the core measurements, but everyone
wants to treat the material as uniform, because you do all your calculations
with one material.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, for years
DNA has been very successful in treating all this shot area, this material they
excite, as roughly uniform material with some faults and fractures through it.
But now, as you go to smaller and smaller shots, and maybe go into a new
tunnel, and maybe get into places that are not zeolitized, now maybe these variable
things come back to haunt you, and you can't treat them as a single element.
The scale is no longer the high yields where you overwhelm the geology. If the
scale is that for only half a kiloton, maybe that fault is going to eat you
alive.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Instead of taking all these
cores, which means you have to drill a hole, why don't you run logging tools?
That's cheaper.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Logs give you one type of
information, the cores give you different types of information. Cores give you
information up to four kilobars, and the calculators like very much to have
that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculations of many kinds are
done. One of the important questions for containment is how the gases in the
cavity, originally at very high temperatures and pressures, flow out into the
surrounding medium. Central to that is the permeability of the materials in the
earth itself, and in the column of stemming materials. One of the first efforts
to measure, and to calculate that was made by Carl Keller, then at Los Alamos,
in the early seventies.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The flow paths of concern were
the stemming column, the chimney, the hypothetical hydrofracture, and that was
about it. The characterization of the medium required for hydrofrac
calculations was never done. The permeabilities were not measured. The in-situ
stresses were not measured. There were no serious measurements even of stresses
near the events. There were serious efforts, but the data certainly weren't of
the quality that there is now. Cavity pressures were not measured. They were
inferred from LOS pipe measurements of pressure, and those weren't too bad. Now
they seem to be what they were thought to be then; a lower bound on the cavity
pressure.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: How could you run a gas flow,
or hydrofracture code? You just listed a number of the important parameters and
said you didn't know them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Cowles and Yerba were the first
two line-of-sight pipe events after Baneberry. Yerba was in a shaft, and so we
had access. So, one of the things we did, having that state of ignorance, was
that I designed a permeability measurement scheme for the Yerba shaft, and the
J-6 folks built the hardware, installed it, and made the measurements. Every
hundred feet in the Yerba shaft we made permeability measurements, and those
are still the only permeability measurements with that kind of resolution in
existence.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were done with
two drill holes. One was the air injection hole, and you measured the flow rate
and the pressure history at the bottom of the hole. They were essentially
packed off so you only had a small volume at the bottom, which was the gas
source, that was free to leak into the medium. And given the pressure history and
the flow rate, you can determine a permeability. The second hole measured the
pressure of the flow field. That's a check, a redundant check, and from that
you can also deduce a permeability. And so with that over-constrained system we
could tell whether or not it was really spherical flow, and we could tell
whether it had come to equilibrium, and some of those kind of things.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yerba
measurements have been invoked countless times as characteristic of alluvium.
Well, alluvium is a highly variable material. One of the most glaring examples
of the differences in alluvium are the Agrini crater, which was 200 feet deep
and bigger at the bottom than at the top, versus Pike, where the alluvium just fell
in like a big sand pile. Some of the alluviums crater very gracefully; they
just fall in and there's a big flow, a big slump down to the bottom.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been other
permeability measurements made by other people. Frank Morrison and the Livermore
folks tried to deduce permeabilities from pressure histories measured during
the stemming process, which is kind of a clever way of doing it. It's pretty
complicated, but in principle you can do it with enough math, and get a measure
of the permeability.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way was to
measure pressure histories in drill-back holes, and from that try to measure
overall permeabilities. I think those are fine for a real gross measurement,
but there are serious problems with them. For one, the volume of the hole can be
a real problem because you have to fill the hole. It's not like you have this ideal
pressure probe which does not influence the flow. You have to fill the hole,
and these flows are very small with that kind of driver, so it takes time to
fill the hole. And then the hole can actually leak off, because they're not all
cased, and most of them are not grouted even if they do have a casing in them.
And so you never know, because you can get strange flows. You can come up in
this hole, and run down to the bottom of that one, and shortcut the medium.
There are a lot of problems with those measurements. So, it gives you a very
gross measure. There are better ways of making measurements.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can even infer
permeabilities. If you presume that you know the noncondensable gas source,
then you can, from the arrival times at the surfaces for those that have
leaked, infer chimney permeability.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, along these same lines,
in the CEP you often hear somebody say something like, "Well, you may get
a fracture to here, or there may be gas transport to there, but this layer has
a lot of permeability and porosity, and so it will just soak everything up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes, you do hear that a lot.
The people making those statements are not very quantitative in those areas, but
they could be. Those kinds of statements could be supported completely with simple
noncondensable gas flow calculations. Or you can even do hydrofrac
calculations. Generally people infer that if you have a high porosity, high air
void content, then you have a high permeability. That's sometimes true, but not
necessarily so.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the permeability
is never measured; it's always inferred from other characteristics. That's
bothered me forever. There have been some pretty strong statements about pore
space available, but it is the permeability that determines whether it's really
available. Some air voids are not available; they're in pumice shards, for instance,
and they're sealed off.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near the detonation point the
shock pressures, the stresses and the strains the material undergoes, and the
time scales on which they occur are beyond those that can be created in the
laboratory. Data from instruments located in the material near the shot point
can give some information, but the environment is severe, and such experiments are
extremely difficult to do. Carl Smith has done extensive work on developing
ways to make such measurements in the field, on both nuclear events and high
explosive experiments.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I have principally done gauging
work, working on gauge development techniques, trying to make in-situ equation
of state measurements. Equation of state measurements typically are made in the
laboratory on small samples. Of course, if the sample breaks you discard it,
and get an intact sample. But field work invariably involves fractures, and
faults, and things like that, and so the big push for many years was how to
develop techniques, and how to make measurements for in-situ equation of state
type work.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equation of state
measurements principally revolve around the area from the near elastic into the
shock wave regime, so you're through the yield range of soft rocks, like tuffs.
That's from like half a kilobar up to the ten kilobar regime, where the yield
effects take place, and that's where the unknowns are in the equations of
states.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such work you need
measurements of both motion and stress, because of the three dimensionality of
the meaurements in the field. In gas-gun work you have one dimension, and you
can take stress measurements and get the motion measurements out of them, through
the Hugoniot equations of state. On a gas-gun type of shot you slice the rock,
put in these material gauges, which can be as thin as mils, and then glue all
the layers back together. The shock passes through the rock from one end to the
other, and so it's one dimensional.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In measurements in
the field, because of the spherical divergence, you need the hoop stresses, the
radial strains and the radial stresses, and particle velocity measurements. And
so, very quickly, you become aware that the Achilles heel of all that work is
in developing instruments to make viable measurements.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventies were
the days when we started developing the so-called ytterbium gauge. Ytterbium is
an odd-ball element that sits off the periodic chart, and has a very strange
electronic structure. As discovered by Bridgeman and others, it has a very wild
stress-piezoresistive effect. In other words, as you squeeze, it changes it's resistance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a field event you
don't have the ability to build an in-material gauge, as you do on a gas-gun
shot. You have to drill holes, insert the gauges, and put in grouting material.
The concern then is, does the grout material match the host in some way. In particular,
you want a measurement that is representative of the free-field stress in the
rock, in a material that is not the rock itself. That's the so-called inclusion
problem that people have worked on for numerous years.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You say you want the grout to
match the rock in some way; which characteristics are most important?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Compressibility. In other
words, does the grout deform in the same way as the host rock.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When you get into the ten
kilobar range, you're in the region where the tuffs are plastic. That means
you're near the edge of the cavity, where it's still growing. How do you make
things survive?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith</span></b><span class="calibre10">: They don't. Principally it's
the cables and electrical leads that are destroyed. Sometimes we can go in on a
mine-back and find these gauges. When we find them, the first thing we do is see
if the gauge is still intact. Almost invariably it is, but the leads that have
been severed, or torn off the package, or somewhere something like a fault has
moved differentially and sheared the cables.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we're getting
out of the gauges now is the arrival time, a rise to peak, and then a little
bit of unloading, enough stress wave unloading so we can say that we have
indeed captured the peak, rather than having it go up and stop before it
reaches the top. One of the efforts nowadays is to enhance those recordings,
and to incease the recording times by building armored cables, and so on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build stonger
cables we're now using a technique that uses wire-rope. The first time we did
that we took a wire rope, took off the outside strands, replaced the center
core with the electrical cable, and then wrapped the outside wires back on the
rope. Now we've gotten sophisticated, and we're going to a wire-rope
manufacturer to have the cables built that way. At the end of a production run
on something of about the right size, we stick our spool of cable at the back
of the machine, and have the wire-rope made with our electrical cable as the
center.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock wave damages the
materials through which it passes, and changes their properties. Those
properties are of importance in what occurs in the later time processes around
the cavity. Attempting to reproduce in the laboratory the damage that occurs
due to the shock loading is extremely difficult to do, and the material
properties measured on such damaged rock samples as can be produced may be
quite different than those of materials near the detonation. Persons attempting
to develop models to predict the ground response must often infer the material
properties by trying to match their calculations to data such as arrival times,
peak values, and decay times of the pressure pulse.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: One of the really interesting
experiments we did was on one of Sandia's shots called One Ton, which was done
by Carl Smith. We obtained, from the working point region of One Ton, big,
twelve inch core. We took that to SRI, cut it, machined it, and put it in our
HE charges with the wires, to measure the response of that tuff from the
working point of the One Ton HE shot. We also took core to Terra Tek, and
measured, in the laboratory, the strength properties of that same material.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both S-Cubed and Pac
Tech did calculations of the SRI test, and of One Ton. This was before the
shot. Then Sandia shot One Ton, and made good stress measurements all around
it. I asked Sandia not to tell the calculators what the results were.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had asked the
calculators to take the properties of the cores that Terra Tek had measured,
and calculate the SRI test. Then they could see the SRI test results, and they
could take those results and modify their equation-of-state if they wanted to,
and then they were to predict the One Ton results.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We met at S-Cubed,
and they had their viewgraphs of the stress histories at the various ranges,
which had been pre-selected on the SRI tests and on the One Ton tests. We had
pre-selected the scales to use in the plots of the results, so you could
overlay them. Sandia would put down the measurement from One Ton, and S-Cubed would
put down their stress history, and then Pac Tech would put down their stress
history, right on top. The correlation between the predictions and the
measurements was really quite good. It wasn't equally good at all ranges. The
calculations were better close-in than they were far-out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We discovered, out of
that series, that the way Terra Tek was measuring the pressure versus volume
curve was not good. They just put the sample in the holder and squeezed it.
From that they would get a pressure versus volume curve. However, if they put
the sample in the holder, squeezed it up to the overburden stress, where the
samples had been obtained, and let it sit there for a while, it would creep to
a lower volume. Doing that sort of replaced the sample in the mountain, and now
when they ran their pressure versus volume curve they got much lower
compaction. It turned out that you needed lower compaction in order to match
the results. That was a really instructive series, where we compared our predictions
and our procedures to reality. Sandia was very helpful on that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patch</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The most important things that
go into the models are the mechanical test data that are done in the
laboratory, on cores. And those tests have some serious limitations that
everybody understands. The people doing the tests certainly do, and the users do
as well. One of the most serious limitations is that they are limited in the
total amount of strain, because they can only squash the rock so much. Nuclear
bombs, near where the bomb is, have a way of scrunching the rock a whole lot.
That strain path is just not accessible in the laboratory.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: My impression is that they can
go up to about four kilobars.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patch</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes, they can go to about four
kilobars. We have gotten up to six kilobars at Terra Tek, and I think eight
kilobars is doable in a Terra T ek type test. They can go up to twenty-five
kilobars, but the problem is, you don't get out the data you need. What you're really
looking for is the response of the rock in terms of its deviatoric response,
and so on. Just pushing on a rock and measuring how much it squeezes gives you
some data, but there are many other things you want to know. So, it doesn't
help just to go to some high stress level.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other factor is
that you can load the core to four kilobars by loading it axially, but you can
only deform it so much before you reach the limits of the machine. The problem
is that in the ground, rock that's squeezed to four kilobars subsequently moves
out a long ways, and undergoes a lot of strain. It laterally stretches and it compresses
axially, and that occurs at much less than four kilobars. A great deal of that
motion might be at only a quarter or half, or maybe three-quarters of a kilo
bar. A lot of that deformation goes on at low levels, and one could track that
in the laboratory, except that there are mechanical limitations on the machinery.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem we
have with mechanical test data, and in some ways it's almost more serious, is
that in the ground, when the material is deformed there is a funny kind of
lateral constraint. To first order the material is forced to move out spherically
symmetrically. Maybe block motion happens later on, and other funny things, but
by and large, if you go in and look at any given piece of material, you can
pretty much convince yourself that it's been homogeneously moved out and
stretched. To the zeroth order it's an isovolumetric strain path. If you try to
do that on a sample in the laboratory, you can do the compression part of it.
Once you try to mimic the part of the strain path that amounts to stretching it
laterally, and taking up that so it is kind of isovolumetric, the rock wants to
fracture along a shear plane. It wants to form these shear planes, and now
suddenly it's not a continuum material anymore. You're doing a friction test in
a way, and you get data out of the test that looks reasonable. The only problem
is, it doesn't have any relationship to the way the material is behaving either
in the field or in any kind of continuum sense. That's one of the serious problems,
and we have to finesse our way around that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I've been working for a number
of years, trying to understand how the rock gets damaged. I have not been able
to get data in tuff, because its permeability is so low, for effective stress modeling.
So, I assume the laboratory data we have has the pore pressure built into it,
because the strengths are lower because of the saturation. I am still trying to
get measures of how much of the material is damaged from the shot.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tried to do a
laboratory material properties test at Terra Tek that would go along the strain
paths. Unfortunately, you cannot confine the material in the laboratory like it
is underground. Underground it's confined by adjacent material doing the same thing.
You have membranes around it in the laboratory, with pressures on them, but you
can only measure the strains in a couple of locations around the circumference.
And, you don't even know what path you're on. As you start to unload the
material, you get a through-going fracture, so those samples are worthless for
material tests after that. So, that work was unsuccessful.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another set
of data on reentries and core samples taken at the time of Hybla Gold, which
was near Dining Car. These show that the samples that were near Dining Car were
damaged greatly. Their strengths were extremely low, much lower than we can reproduce
in the laboratory by damaging the material to the same peak stress levels. So,
my hypothesis was that the total shear-strain the material has seen is greatly
different, based on calculations, than with any model. And that's the difference;
we should make the damage that we see a function of shear-strain.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late 1990 I and
Bill Proffer, who did the calculations for me, used that Terra Tek data to do
some residual stress calculations. Those calculations give grossly different
residual stresses. The peak in the residual stress is further out, but it's
still considerably higher than the cavity pressure. Even though the material is
now much weaker, peak stresses are the same as with the other model. So are peak
velocities, so are cavity pressures, and cavity size. The material goes out
more, comes back more, and ends up at about the same place. But, it undergoes a
lot more plastic work. It gives low peak residual stresses further out, but
gives almost no residual stresses out to, let's say, the range of the FAC, the
Fast Acting Closure. The other model would say a third of the way from the
cavity to FAC you've got strong residual stresses, much higher than cavity
pressure.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that's why we
see radiation as far as the FAC on many of the DNA events. There's a nice
closure, but it's permeable, and the residual stresses aren't there to keep it
closed. And so, you get a little seep of material through that grout to the F
AC. It doesn't influence containment because there's a gas-tight closure
further down, but there's a little seep. Operationally it means we can't examine
and take out the FAC anymore. But I think that's in line with the new
calculations I've been doing with this new model.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that
post-shot we have much lower strength in the material. When this strength
reduction occurs is anyone's guess. My guess is that it doesn't occur when the
peak stress is reached. The material continues to strain all the while it's
moving out, and the strains it gets to may be a factor of three higher than the
strain it sees at the peak stress of the shock wave.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently saw some
interesting data. Terra Tek had taken preshot samples from Disko Elm, and they
did the normal tests on them. Then they did SEM tests, the scanning electron
microscope tests. Then they used what they call a Wood's Metal approach, where
they use melted metal, which gets into the open pores and fractures of the
sample. They shine a laser on the sample, and they get marvelous color pictures
of the microstructure at different scales, even better than they get from the
SEM pictures.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did the same
thing to materials they took post-shot, at the same stress levels. The pictures
are totally different. At two kilobars, from samples that were damaged in the
laboratory by squeezing, you see some signs of pore crush-up, but just a little
bit. Once in a while you see a little fracture. At two kilobars, in the in situ,
shot damaged material, there are fractures throughout it. It looks like a
totally different process has occurred.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, sure. The material near
the shot doesn't get just compressed. It also gets stretched tangentially,
because it's moving out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's right. Exactly. And
that's true even at two kilobars. That's what I mean by the strain test. I'm
using shear-strain, because mathematically it's a principal invariant. The
lateral strain is tensile, the radial strain is compressive. They add together,
and you get four percent, roughly, at four kilobars peak stress. That's almost
all radial strain, but then it keeps stretching as it moves out almost
incompressibly. The strain is enormous; you can get twelve percent strain, and
that's what I'm trying to model. I don't know the numbers, the parameters, but
when it reaches ten percent strain I think it's mush. And we've seen plenty of
mush near the cavity. These results that Terra Tek showed are another confirmation
of that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ristvet</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You get into totally
microfailed material as you get about a quarter of a cavity radius away from
the cavity boundary. You start seeing isolated pockets of this material from
about two cavity radii in, and it is basically like cohesive silt. I would say
its unconfined strength is only a few hundred psi, as a result of the microfracturing.
We've documented that at Terra Tek and USGS, and we see it in the shear wave
drop, and so forth. It's for real.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Terra Tek also did uniaxial
strain, and triaxials on those damaged samples from Disko Elm. They have much
lower strength, and the strengths get lower and lower, within the scatter of
the tuff, as it's been hit harder. I don't know if strain is the right thing to
use, but it's much better than stress.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;App</span></b><span class="calibre10">: In the effective stress there
are theories that the pressure of the water, after it has been shocked and some
unloading has occurred, exceeds the stress in the matrix. Then, essentially the
response of the whole aggregate is determined by the response properties of the
water. And the more water you have, the more that's going to occur. In an
effective stress model, the strength, after the material has been loaded up to
a certain point, comes back to zero. There's no strength left, and it is the
water in the pores that determines the response of the material.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason the
effective stress models have not been adopted universally is their extreme
sensitivity to small changes in mechanical behavior such as dilation, porosity
increase due to shear induced micro fractures. Pore pressure, and therefore
shear strength, is very sensitive to such increases in porosity. Yet, in the
field, we do not observe huge variations in observed phenomena from site to
site, at least not at the scale that is suggestd could occur due to dilation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: In P tunnel there was a small
change in something that made a big change in the response of the ground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;App</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, yes. DNA does have a
prime example that is contrary to what I was just saying. Why was Mission Cyber
so different from Disko Elm? Those were two shots that were very similar. If
I'd thought of that a minute ago when I started on that little spiel about not
seeing much difference, I might not have said it. There is apparently some
change so hidden that nobody's been able to identify it. Thus far, the only
difference that has been identified is the minerology, and we cannot determine
how that would alter the phenomenology. One site has been altered to zeolite,
and the other hasn't. The mechanical properties from both sites are about the
same. There is no known answer at this time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: With the things we usually
successfully measure, the free-field ground motion, the calculational results
do not tell you which model is better. Residual stresses would, and we're still
trying to measure them; real hard we're trying to measure them. The problem has
been gauge breakage, and cable breakage.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: How about a self-contained,
hardened instrument that you recover after the shot?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Great idea! We tried that with
the SCEMS, the Self Contained Environment Measurement System, a big heavy piece
of equipment that does that. And the batteries went dead on it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a paper by a
guy named Starfield, in which he talks about the limits of our ability to
understand rocks, and classifies calculations by how much data is available on
the material; how much data is available to isolate the physical models that
are important. It's a very interesting paper. It really tells you how limited
you are in rock mechanics, in your understanding. That's not to say you don't
learn anything about how materials behave by looking at measurements, and
trying to match measurements. You need to know as much as you can about the
properties of the rock, and I get very exercised every time I'm at a CEP,
because they go into enormous detail about sonic velocities, and physical
properties, but they don't talk about strength. And containment is, to zeroth<i class="calibre13">
</i>order, a strength phenomenon. Water matters, for cavity pressure, and it
has an effect on strength. Gas porosity matters in attenuating peak motions,
and surface velocities. Why anyone cares about surface velocities for these
deeply buried shots I don't know. I guess it's easy to measure.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I don't think anybody knows how
to measure the in-situ strength, un fortunately.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's true. Now, Bob Schock
looked at how you could determine strength from the measurements we have. He
found a strong correlation with the shear modulus, the modulus of rigidity, the
shear wave velocity. Anyone of those, because they all use the same quantity,
really. I always thought an improvement would be to measure the in-situ shear wave
velocity, because you can get a shear modulus, and from that maybe get an idea
of the strength. Not the full story, but a feeling. Now, John Rambo, at
Livermore, looks at drilling rates as a measure of strength. He's come up with some
interesting correlations.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: But the drilling rate depends
on a lot of things you don't know. How sharp is the bit, how much weight is on
it, are the drillers pushing today, or taking it easy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I understand. But it's
something that's worth looking at.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing we
spent a great deal of time on was Pile Driver. I must have done thirty or more
one-dimensional calculations, and a number of 2-D calculations, to develop a
model for the in-situ strength of the Pile Driver granite. The intact rock was
very strong, but the pulse width measurements that Perret and Bass, at Sandia, did,
and SRI did showed wider pulse widths, which shows weaker material. By pulse
width I mean velocity versus time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There are folks who might say,
"The rock is very strong. We've taken good, intact cores to the lab,
checked them out, and it's strong rock all right. No doubt about it." And
there are other folks who might say, "That's all very well, but that's a mountain
there, which is not intact. It's full of cracks and fractures which weakens the
rock."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: A one-foot joint spacing.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: For example. And so, you have
all these numbers from these unfractured cores, but you've got deal with all
this fractured rubble, to exaggerate a little.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I spent a considerable period
of my life dealing with that. Ted Cherry's idea, and he first thought of it
back at Livermore, was that there was water in the fractures. At this point I
think it's more likely there's clay there. Either way it results in a weaker, lubricated
joint system. Ted modeled that with an effective stress model. We tried a
number of things, and that's what I spent a lot of time on. What could we do
that was reasonable, where we used the laboratory strength of the granite,
which was superstrong, and then brought in some physical process to reduce the
strength? We used the effective stress model, and ran 2-D calculations which we
calibrated to pieces of data; Perret's underground particle velocity measurements,
the geologic structure, which was a weak weathered layer, then a layer where
Perret measured the wave speeds to be slightly less, and then the working point
material.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were able to match
all the ground motion measurements, both underground and free surface, with
that model. The peaks were a little different, but the SRI data is from a
different azimuth than the Perret data, and that may explain it. We were able
to match, with a 2-D calculation, that data, but I don't believe it. I don't
believe that effective stress is the true model. I think it's more something
that happens in the joints, and that could be tied in with the pore pressure in
the joints. We had a program, which DARPA funded, that’s consisted of
small-scale explosive tests at SRI, using 3/8 of a gram of HE, to look at this.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were in granite
cylinders. I was doing calculations, supervising the experiments that Alex
Florence was doing up at SRI, and having special laboratory material properties
tests done by Chris Schultz, at LaMont Dougherty Geologic Observatory at Columbia
University. In these experiments SRI was measuring particle velocities, looking
at wet versus dry, where they measured the pore fluid pressures preshot.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had overburden
pressures on those cylinders. We put everything in a balloon, pumped up the gas
pressure, and then blew the balloon. The granite just splintered into pieces.
Then we put lead shot around the cylinder to let it go out slowly, and the
granite microfractured. That fracture spacing, when the cube root of the yield
was scaled up to Pile Driver, gave us, within a factor of two, that one-foot
joint spacing. We were trying to get to the bottom of this question, and we
spent three or four years on it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally concluded
that the strain rate effects in the small scale experiments were too great.
They decreased the strength so much that they were not relevant to Pile Driver.
However, they still showed an effect of water, but not as strong an effect as I
believed to be in-situ.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the number of events increased
more and more information accumulated about the events that were taking place.
New people joined the program, perhaps an old-timer or two left, and there was increasing
difficulty in relating a current shot to the experience on an earlier one. What
previous experience had there been? Had there been a similar geologic setting
for a shot, similar material properties, a similar yield at a similar depth?
Eventually there was recognition of the need to bring together in some accessible
fashion what was beginning to be a large amount of data.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: In the late sixties, while I
was still involved with slifer measurements, I and a lady by the name of Mary
Lou Higuera were set together in a nice large room in Building 111, and told to
start collecting all the data on our shots. So we started collecting data, and
I wrote a simple version of a data base that would work. I decided what the
logic should be, and interestingly over the years that piece of logic has still
remained as one of the ways of getting the data out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What sort of things did you
have in your data bank?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yield mostly, at first. The
groups that I was working with were very interested in yield, because seismic
happened to be a big thing at that time. So we had different kinds of seismic
yields in there. The old slifer yields were put in there as sort of a comparison,
and there was some thought of going back and reworking all of the old seismic
data. And, it went further than that. We tried to put a little bit of geology
in also.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, after
Baneberry, the tone of it changed dramatically. Then it became very interesting
as to what caused things to leak, and were there any clues that could be put
together to extrapolate to serious problems of that sort. I recall the day
after Baneberry happened, of looking in the database, and gee, there seemed to
be a definite correlation of shooting shots shallower than six hundred feet and
leakages showing up. So I wrote a very limited memo to about four or five
people. Billy Hudson then took some of that data and extrapolated it in a more
formal sense, and that became policy. Some of those data bank runs that we did
in those early days really did cause the development of some of the procedures
that we use nowadays.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That data collection
is still being carried on. Now Los Alamos information is included as well. The
two Laboratories do trade this information to update both of their data banks.
Los Alamos independently started a data bank about the time of Baneberry, and did
find some similar correlations to what we found.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: One of the things I did before
Baneberry was to develop a library of shot data. So, I evolved the first data
bank at Los Alamos, and I got it to print out in regular book format so I could
trim the printouts and bind them. Then I had a data book in which I had all the
shot names, and the dates, and the depths of burial, the yields, and everything
else that was known about them. That was one of the things that was picked up
very quickly, and they decided to expand that data book to include all the Lab
data on the shots. The device designers also had their own shot data book, but
it was more crude; it had been developed much earlier.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, as I
remember, there were like 72 underground events, total. And there were only Los
Alamos events included in the data. We didn't even think about Livermore;
somehow that was irrelevant experience. We were really pretty parochial. And
the Livermore data wasn't readily available either. So, I only put together
those Los Alamos events, and I remember the highest yield event I had was Halfbeak,
and the lowest yield was Solendon.<div class="calibre8" id="calibre_link-78"></div>

<h2>Chapter 7: Logging and Logging Tools</h2>
<br>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Paul Fenske, before he turned to
hydrology, spent several years working for oil companies, doing logging on
holes thought to have penetrated an oil bearing formation. These were small
diameter, cased, fluid-filled holes often drilled to depths of many thousands of
feet. Here the problem was not to obtain the kinds of data about rock
properties needed for code calculations, but to determine where, if at all, the
oil bearing regions were so the casing could be perforated there, and the oil
pumped out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Fenske</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There was a standard set of
geophysical logs; there was a resistivity log, a neutron log, and what was
basically a conductivity log. It was one of those logs where you had two coils,
and we transmitted from one coil to the other. The ability to transmit from one
coil to the other was given by the conductivity of the formation. We would run
those induction logs, I guess they would call them today.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The neutron log was a
porosity log, essentially. We looked for the hydrogen content of the rocks. If
you have a real clean formation you would find a difference between the gas in
the well, and the hydrogen content, but most of the time you couldn't depend on
that, because most of the time the formation wasn't that uniform. It wasn't
isotropic or homogeneous, and so you couldn't depend on that. There have been a
lot of advances made in the logs, how you interpret the data, and what kind of
logs you use since that time. This was in 1952, and we had, by today's
technology, some rather simple logs; induction logs, neutron logs, resistivity
logs.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	We used those for the
purpose of defining what the structure was in the area, and also interpreted
them in terms of where the pay zones, the high porosity zones, were. Basically,
we were trying to determine if there was porosity there or not. At that time
the logs were not good enough to determine if there was really oil there or not.
You could tell if there was porosity, and you could tell if you were dealing
with a shale, or dealing with limestone, or sandstone. You could tell where the
formation tops were, and the formation bottoms, and things like that. But you could
not really tell, from the logs, where you had oil. What you can do, because you
also run the resistivity log, and oil is essentially a nonconductor compared to
water, you can by a combination of those logs make a pretty good guess as to
whether you have oil, if you have a combination of high porosity and high
resistivity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The gamma ray log,
which we also used, will show you that you are not in a shale, because shale
has higher radioactivity than a limestone, for example. And, the neutron log
will show you that you have a rock that has a lot of holes in it - high
porosity. The resistivity log will show that there is something in those holes
other than just water. Basically, the induction log was better for that than a
resistivity log. When you had the induction log you could do pretty well in
wells that you knew something about. If you were in an area, and you knew
something about the area because you had taken cores, and had measured the
porosity, you could do pretty well.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Joe Hearst has been a central
figure in the development of logging tools and methods at the Livermore
Laboratory. The initial impetus, at the Test Site, for ways of determining the
various in-situ properties of different materials encountered in drill holes
came from the Plowshare program. In particular, the use of nuclear explosives
to form craters of different sizes was envisaged as a means for creating
harbors and canals. To predict the yield of the explosive required at what
depth in a particular formation to produce the desired result required both the
development of computer codes, and a means of obtaining the properties of the
rocks involved as input data for those codes. The oil companies had developed
various tools to measure properties associated with the presence of oil when an
exploratory hole seeking an oil-bearing formation was drilled, and it was from
this base of experience that the development of instruments that could be used
in the nuclear programs came.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When I was working on the
Plowshare program I had to calculate an event; I think it was Danny Boy, a
cratering shot. One of the things you had to put in the code as one of the rock
properties was the sound speed. Well, I discovered when I was given the sound
speed from laboratory measurements, the calculated signal arrived at the
surface in about half the time it did in real life.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I thought perhaps
something was wrong with the numbers I'd been given. So, I decided I should go
to the field and measure the sound speed. I went to the field, and I reinvented
what is known as the uphole survey. What you do is you make a noise like an explosion,
underground, and you time the signal coming to the surface. I also reinvented
the refraction survey. There you hit a hammer on the ground and listen to the
signal coming back.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Of course, refraction
surveys had been standard for years, but I didn't know that. I invented it
again out of ignorance. Then I decided maybe I didn't believe the density
numbers either, and I believe that I reinvented the density logging tool, or
re-conceived it, using gamma ray reflection, or gamma ray back-scattering. That's
how I got into the logging business. I had all these numbers that I didn't
believe, that didn't work, and so I started reinventing some of these things.
And then I discovered, first of all, that there was a logging group at the Test
Site, which I hadn't known about. And, secondly, that there was a logging
industry, but I didn't know that either, at the time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Then, one day - I was
in a ride pool with Don Rawson, who was at the time the head of geology in K
Division - Don said, "Joe, how would you like to take charge of logging
for K Division, and be in charge of the logging effort in Nevada?" I
almost said, "What's logging?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	But that's how I got
into it. I needed the data. I don't remember when I found out about the logging
group in Nevada, but at first I didn't even know about them. They were
developing seismic measurements, and improving on them, and they were using commercial
logging companies, which I had never heard of, like Birdwell, and Wellex. I was
reinventing all this stuff in a vacuum.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: One of the things researchers
are supposed to do is look at the literature, Joe.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I didn't even know there was a
literature.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The logging people
that I knew in Nevada were in support of Plowshare, because the Plowshare
people were interested in breaking up the rocks, and when or where the signal
came to the surface. They were doing cratering shots, and they were worried
about damage, and earthquakes. The Panama Canal effort was what was funding all
this, so that was what the Nevada group was working on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: In the Nevada group we were
trying to develop new logging tools. And, we were evaluating the commercially
available tools from Birdwell, and I think Wellex. We weren't very happy with what
we were seeing, because those tools were all borrowed from the oil patch, and
those people were not interested in the same things we were, at the time. We
were interested more in physical properties than in blips on an electric log.
On the cratering events we were able to drill a lot of holes and pull out
samples, and make measurements on those, and get material properties in that
way.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	So, during this time
we were developing logging tools to measure these unknowns, and density was one
of the big items we were looking at. We had just gotten one of the old 1620 IBM
computers, and that was a miracle machine at that time. I learned all about
programming that. We bought the second version of the Rand Tablet, which was a
digitizing device, which had etched lines on it. I had a stylus, and you could
digitize logs with this electronic pencil. For every point you got, it would
punch a number in a piece of paper tape. So, I wrote programs to do this
translation, and I wrote the programs for the IBM 1620. We would put on a reel
of paper tape that was maybe about eight to ten inches in diameter, turn it on
just before we went home, and this thing would run all night long digitizing a
density log. Then we'd process it in a Cal Comp plotter, which was an old
version of a plotter, and convert what was kilocounts at one time to density,
which was the real thing.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What was the source of the
input data? What kind of an instrument were you using?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What it was for the density log
was a cobalt 60 source. The gammas would backscatter from the formation after
the source was held up against the wall of a hole at various locations. It was
a gamma-gamma density; the backscatter was the indication of the density. I
forget whether there was two or three feet of separation between the sensor and
receiver. You couldn't get the receiver too far away, or you wouldn't sense
anything; if it was too close you'd only sense the source. You then had to go
through various calibrations to get the density.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	We were also dealing
at that time with a firm called Birdwell, which was big in the logging field,
and which did the Test Site logging. We were trying to do our processing
in-house, and to develop a whole logging program. That eventually became the modern
logging programming we now have. Those were the early days of developing those
sort of things.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Why didn't the Lab use the
commercial tools? Why build up an in-house logging capability? There were
companies that had logged hundreds of miles of holes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Because the conditions were
different. The commercial tools were developed for deep, small holes that would
be f1uidfilled because they were below the water table. We were logging in emplacement
holes, so first of all, we were logging above the water table, and almost all
commercial tools were, and are, designed to work in water-filled holes, or
liquid-filled holes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	When we were trying
to do seismic surveys, at first we tried to couple them with water. We'd drill
an eight-inch hole, dump a truckload of water into it, and it would flush like
a toilet. We learned you can't do that. Even for seismic surveys we had to
develop a new method of stemming with sand and things like that, because the commercial
methods wouldn't work in the holes we had.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	So, we needed methods
for a dry hole, and a big hole. First a dry hole. For Plowshare we didn't need
big hole tools, we needed dry hole tools. And so we developed dry hole methods.
We also needed higher accuracy for many of these things than was available from
the commercial tools at the time. First of all, velocity; our first paper was
on an uphole survey, which was a standard procedure, which was an order of
magnitude higher accuracy than industry used. For the short distances which
were used on the cratering shots, we needed the higher accuracy. Or, at least
we thought we did. For density, we had rough, dry holes, and we had to develop tools
that would work in them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The first thing we
worked on was a lock-in geophone, to get better accuracy in measuring
velocities. I didn't work on that much; that was done by Dick Carlson and the
people in Nevada. We used that for downhole surveys rather than uphole. The
geophones would lock into the borehole, and measure the travel time from an HE
shot on the surface. We were measuring the sound speed for the code
calculations. One of the reasons for that is that laboratory measurements on
samples, especially for sound speed, have nothing to do with field
measurements.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	For laboratory
measurements you take a core sample, a nice solid core which doesn't have any
cracks in it, and which doesn't fall apart. In the field things aren't like
that. I remember the Sulky event, where you could look down the hole and see
cracks you could put your arm into. And of course, the acoustic signal has to
come through that broken up, fractured material. The Test Site is very nasty
that way. And, the fractures at the Test Site are not filled with water -
they're filled with air, which gives a tremendous attenuation for acoustic
signals. That's why we had to make those measurements with the geophones. There
is that factor of two that I mentioned, between the laboratory and field
measurements. People still fall into that trap sometimes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Don Larsen developed
some very thin velocity gauges, and we then could look at the velocity history
of rock samples in the lab, using very small HE charges. We also worked a lot
on stress gauges, and we're still working on them. Checking calculations with
actual measurements is a lifetime program.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The Buggy event, which used
five simultaneous detonations, was a great success, in that it made a real
ditch. It demonstrated that you could actually calculate these row charge effects.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Before Buggy was Palanquin,
which demonstrated you couldn't calculate everything.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The only real work that was
being done was being done for Plowshare, and basically being done for the
cratering shots. Now, the Plowshare people had various other ideas, such gas stimulation.
Did you do any work on those kind of things?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Logging was logging, but for
most of the other things commercial logs could be used. Another thing was
verification. There was Salmon, in Mississippi, and Dick Carlson especially did
a lot of logging work on Salmon. In the second place, on Salmon, if you recall,
the ground shock caused much more damage to buildings than people had anticipated.
It was a real surprise. We then started bringing seismic people into our group,
and we started getting involved in what we would now call verification work. We
then did logging for that, as well as calculations and lab experiments.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: On device development shots, as
differentiated from Plowshare events, were there samples or logs taken?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I don't think the test program
people did much of that. We didn't get involved with the test program until
Baneberry. Plowshare was vanishing, and the Lab also had the first big
reduction-in-force. Just about that time, very providentially, along came Baneberry,
and that put us back in business, logging for the test program. I was still
doing calculations at that time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What logs could you do at that
time?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: We could do almost anything
that we can do now. There were very sophisticated acoustic things, which
weren't useful at the Test Site, but as soon as we started working on
verification, then we could use the conventional stuff for things like Salmon
and Sterling, and so on. I recall doing lots of seismic surveys on Pahute Mesa
events, and I think it was pre-Baneberry.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Now, the quality
wasn't as good. The measurements weren't as sophisticated as they are today,
but the techniques were available in the sixties. There's very little new that
has come along since then. The only thing, really, is borehole gravity, which
was conceived in the fifties, but not used in the field until later. And it's
still not very commercial. You could, in the sixties, do acoustic, density, electrical
logs.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The epithermal
neutron log was a commercial tool; we just used it. We did invent one density
logging tool, which was for Plowshare, and we subsequently stopped using it. It
was a rugosity insensitive density logging tool. When we got into bigger holes
we stopped using it, and started using commercial tools, and calibrating them,
and living with the rugosity effects.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	So, it was all
commercial tools, and we had to make them work. That was the switch from Plowshare
to verification and test. We started making commercial tools work. The only
tool we developed that is still in use is the dry-hole acoustic log. The other
tools could be made to work; basically, they had to be calibrated for dry
holes. The thing that I did with the epithermal neutron tool was, after many
years of effort, and learning to run Monte Carlo codes, and things like that,
was to convince management to build me a calibrator for dry holes. It was boxes
of carefully mixed materials, and those boxes are expensive.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Boxes with dirt in them?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: They had to be big boxes,
because the neutrons go long distances. And the dirt had to be carefully
designed to give you what you wanted, and to give it uniformly and accurately.
Actually, that calibrator didn't work very well.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	What we ended up
doing, because of engineering and money constraints, was, we made cells a foot
square and six feet high so we could put them together to make a rectangular
parallelepiped, to be technical, which was six feet high, by three feet by five
feet. Basically it was a slab.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	We put carefully
measured amounts of material in each one of the boxes, and shook them to get it
uniform. We calculated what materials we needed, and mixed them. We used sand,
and marbles - we actually had a million marbles, a whole truck load of marbles -
and aluminum oxide. Among other things we had to control the density, and so we
had to make mixes of materials of different sizes to get it dense enough to do
what we wanted. We used marbles, and sand to get higher densities. And aluminum
oxide, to get even higher densities. To a neutron, aluminum looks very much
like silicon. Then we poured in water, and we also had some activated alumina,
which could soak up some water.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	We did all that, and
it was still not well done. Part of the problem was that the mixes were made
here, and they were sealed in these aluminum cans, and then they were trucked
over the Sierra. That made the cans expand, because of the low pressure as they
went over the mountains. And <i class="calibre13">so, </i>when the cans got to Nevada they were
bulging. Consequently, they never fit well together.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: All you had to do was to put a
little pinhole in them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: They didn't think of it.
Remember, they were sealed to keep the water in there. There were actually
reinforcing rods in them, but that didn't work well enough, and so they bulged.
When you put them together and squeezed as hard as you could, they still weren't
flat; they had gaps, and bumps, and wiggles. And so, they were never satisfactory.
But it took a lot of persuasion to get management to let me build that
facility, and that was what I contributed - the calibration facility.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	There were problems
with our first calibrations. We did two procedures. Our main effort, which was
to simulate a big hole, was this three by five foot wall. And, we took one box
out of the middle of the fifteen boxes to mock up a small hole; that hole, of
course, was square.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Those results are
quite different from those in the small cylindrical hole we now have in our in
our new calibrator. A logging tool is cylindrical, and is up against a wall
that is either cylindrical or flat, and the major effect is right in the front
of the tool. One of the things we discovered was that even in a 72-inch hole
there is a hole-size effect on a neutron log. That's why we had to build this
ENS - the Epithermal Neutron Special, instead of the ENP - the Epithermal
Neutron Porosity - to take care of the hole-size effect. The Geologic Survey
people are unhappy because we almost always get higher values with the ENS.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The ENS was special
because it had more shielding. We put that bigger shielding on to compensate
because we were up against the slab. The slab was to simulate the big hole -
infinite radius. But because it wasn't right, wasn't really effectively
infinite, we had to put in this extra shielding. We also pulled out one of the
boxes in the middle to simulate a small hole. Now that we've built our new system,
we've found that neither of those simulations is particularly good.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Our new calibrator is
two cylinders, fifteen feet in diameter, with a six foot diameter hole in the
middle. They are vertical cylinders, six or eight feet high,-and somewhere
between twelve and fifteen feet outside diameter, with a six foot diameter hole
in the middle. They are made of pie-shaped wedges; each of the two cylinders
has six cells fiIIed with the material. It cost us like a quarter of a million
dollars to fiII them - REECO prices. You have to fill them very, very
carefully, and we did a lot of studying of the mixing of solids. We even sent
our engineer to a meeting on the subject, in Southern California. We came to
the conclusion that we could not make uniform mixes of the solids we wanted to
mix. The technology does not exist to make good uniform mixes of solids of different
sizes, or even of the same size.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: My mother can do that when she
makes sticky buns with raisins in them. She gets a pretty uniform mix.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, probably on that scale
you can do it. But we concluded that we just could not guarantee a uniform mix,
with dry particulates. So what we did was, we made layers. Each cell has fifteen
layers, and we know what's in each layer, so we know that at least on that
scale the mix is uniform. We use fifteen layers of the same mix. The layers may
not each be completely homogeneous, but the neutrons see more than one layer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The layers are all
the same recipe, mixed in a concrete mixer. The problem is that the concrete
mixer may not necessarily get things uniform, but it makes it uniform on the
scale that the neutrons see. We put these mixes in place, and then vibrated the
cells to get the right density, because we had to have a known density as well
as a known water content. So, we vibrated these huge cells each time we put in
a layer, to settle it to get the right density. We did all sorts of experiments
on that sort of thing. We did experiments where we would pour stuff into a
container after we mixed it, then shake it to settle it to get the right
density, and it would separate.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, sure. The heavy things
fall down to the bottom. It's the shaking that's doing it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes, but otherwise you can't
get the right density. So, it's probably still not uniform. Afterwards we made
all kinds of measurements with logging tools, and other things. I've got a book
an inch and a half thick describing these mixes. How to mix solids is an
unsolved problem, and there are conferences on the subject. It's important to
places like cookie companies, and places like that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I think the solution
is that you put in liquid, and then you can mix it. If you make a slurry you
can mix it, apparently. But as long as it's a dry solid, you can't. That seems
to be the story. This was a major problem that we spent a lot of time and money
on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	There are calibration
facilities at places like Bendix, in Grand Junction, where they tried to make
mixes of radioactive concrete to calibrate gamma ray logs. It took them years
to discover that they got it wrong. There are American Petroleum Institute test
pits in Houston that are not right, because they couldn't mix it well; they're
not uniform. Mixes just don't do very well, and these test pits where they
tried to mix radioactive concrete don't work. And so, when we built our gamma
ray calibrator we used six foot high, three foot diameter pieces of granite.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Commercial tools are
calibrated in American Petroleum test beds in Houston, in saturated limestone,
and things like that. They are small, water-filled holes, and we have dry big
holes, and dry small holes. And so, we had to simulate that. And also, we have a
much bigger range of water contents and densities. One thing that I did invent
was the idea that you had to compensate the neutron log for density. That's not
a problem in the oil industry, because any time there's a density change there
is also a water content change, because everything is saturated. The holes they
log are deep, and also they're in places where there is a shallow water table.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	So, we had to develop
calibrations to account for that, and we did. We developed ways of correcting
for all those features they don't worry about in industry. We didn't have to
develop tools, we just had to develop calibrations and corrections; ways to use
those tools. That saved lots of effort.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: This new calibrator you have is
bigger, better, and so forth compared to the old square cells. Presumably it
was more expensive also. How was the management persuaded to spend that quarter
of a million dollars?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Actually, it ended up being
more expensive than that. But, partly it was the DOE management that spent it.
I think we succeeded because there is still the tradition of getting better
data, and because there was money in the budget, the DOE budget, to do these
things.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	When I was working
with Frank Morrison I was in charge of research for the containment program. I
had lunch with Frank one day at the bowling alley at the Test Site. I said,
"Frank, we don't need any more research in the containment program. We're
doing our job, and we're not hurting. We have a budget, and there lots of
interesting things we could do that would give us more accurate measurements -
nicer, warmer fuzzy feelings - but they don't improve the containment of the
event one bit."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I was wondering if there was
something new that had occurred; if for some reason better numbers were needed.
For instance, perhaps the verification folks needed better numbers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: No. There was available money,
and we could show the things that were wrong with the existing calibrator. So,
we have better data now. This business of the correction for the bound water,
that's an improvement in the correctness of the numbers, even though it's not
very important.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Your epithermal neutron log
doesn't really measure water; it measures the hydrogen that makes up the water.
And you assume that alI the hydrogen is associated with water.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's correct.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: WelI, your measurements seem to
bother the geologists, because you measure not only the free water, but the bound
water. As far as I know, they measure the free water. They never measure the
bound water.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's correct, but they could
if they tried. They measure the water in samples, and if you heat the samples
hot enough the bound water will come off.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: But the problem is that alI the
data in the data banks that we have that relate to the Test Site only report
the free water. Now you're reporting free water and bound water, and so there's
always more than there is reported in the data bank.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Not always. Only in places
where there is water that is bound, and that's in zeolitic materials, as far as
I know. Or clays, or things that have some clay in them. But yes, the neutron
log seems to give higher values than the sample data, and generally it should.
That should only happen where there's bound water. But, we have a method for
correcting for bound water. We can measure it with nuclear magnetic resonance -
from samples only, which is a little bit cheating, as a reviewer from a journal
pointed out to me. It's cheating to interpolate between samples. There is
nuclear magnetic resonance logging, but it's never been successful. I recently
read a proposal for something that might work, but they aren't there yet. That
tool has also existed since the sixties, but it's never been very good, and it
certainly wouldn't work in big holes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	But there is a
problem there, and I'm not sure the solution is complete; that is, that we can
explain away all the differences between the sample measurements and the log
measurements. But, we think we understand most of it, and yes, the data bank
does have just the free water, and we can now compare free water measurements if
we wish.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: But you do that by cheating a
little bit.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes. Incidentally, the
epithermal neutron log was a Birdwell tool. It was abandoned by the industry,
because it didn't get enough signal, until very recently. Now epithermal
neutron logs are coming back into fashion in industry, and they are using them in
creative ways. Maybe it's just more recognition of neutron poisons, which is
the reason we used epithermal neutrons - the fact that there are things out
there that absorb thermal neutrons. And maybe it's that industry is getting
into more materials where they care about it. But also they've found
constructive ways of using the tool.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The problem, with the
neutron log in particular, and the density log, is that our calibration at zero
gap, and even at a small gap, is excellent. But the correction for gap, when we
measure some gap, is still very poor, because we're doing that badly, somehow.
I don't know why. I think it's poor because I'm measuring the gap at some place
other than the spot where I'm making the neutron measurement. The hole is
rough, and we're making the measurement a foot away from the source, because
the gap measuring device is somewhere else on the tool. That isn't right, but
we don't know how to do it otherwise. We're probably getting the water content wrong;
we're probably overestimating it in many cases.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There are members of the Panel
who have said that they really don't care about all those numbers, and the
geology, unless there is something unusual about it. For instance, they, and I,
feel that the histograms of material properties that are presented are
meaningless, because there have been so many measurements taken that what is at
the Test Site has been bracketed, and what you measure always falls within
those limits.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes. Of course. Norm Burkhard
gave a paper at the containment symposium before last about the rockpile
concept - you should just assume these numbers. I think that's quite reasonable.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: In 1978 there was a session of
the Panel called to consider the question posed by Ink Gates, the then NVO
Manager, as to whether there were ways to reduce the containment related costs.
Without compromising the probability of successful containment, of course.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	One of the
suggestions that was made in 1978 was that Livermore should regard a large
section of the areas they used in Yucca Flat as LANL regards the Sandpile -
call it the gravel pile, or whatever. There is plenty of data to do that, and
when a new hole is drilled, just extrapolate in the data from adjacent holes.
The Livermore Laboratory, for whatever reason, has not chosen to do that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: In 20ax, the containment
scientist wanted to do that, and suggested that we look at the 20ax data and
compare them to the data from nearby holes. We did actually try that for that
event. Well, it turned out that in many of the lithologic units the error bars for
the measured 20ax data lay outside the error bars for the nearby data. They
didn't agree. But, so what?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I don't believe, these days,
that the CEP is the organization that drives the data collection. You've got
people who do calculations, and to do calculations you have to have numbers, and
if you don't have numbers people criticize you for having so many knobs to
twiddle in your code that the results are meaningless. And so, you have to have
numbers. And to get the numbers you either have to have samples, or logging
tools. Samples are expensive.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: And they're not very good
anyhow.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: So, we have to have logging
tools, so we have to have people to do that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I consider it a ritual, but I
earn my living at it, and it's interesting work. As long as you're going to do
it you might as well try to do it well. Although, we wouldn't use the tools we
are using if we were starting now;<i class="calibre13"> </i>we'd use higher technology. We're
still using 1960's technology in much of our stuff at the Test Site.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: With a logging tool there are
two things you can do, and presumably you could do them both at once. One is,
you might not care what the absolute value is; you might only care about where and
how the value changes. The other is that you really want to know what the
absolute value is. How do you deal with that?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, in the first place, you
should actually design the tool differently for the two different uses. For
almost any tool, the larger the source-detector spacing the further you're
averaging over, so the more accurate number you're going to get, but the less definition
you're going to get of a boundary. There is a basic problem, before you start a
logging program, of deciding what you want, and why. There's always a balance
between accuracy of the value and accuracy of the depth, which compete, and
cost.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	For the Soviet test
site a U.S. committee got together and decided what logs they wanted to verify
Soviet tests. There was this list of logs that were wanted, and we made
decisions about the necessary logging tools to send over to Russia. This committee
would say, "We want these logs." And maybe, "We want them to
this accuracy," but usually not. But not, "We want them
because." The cortex people wanted them for one thing, the Geological
Survey wanted them for another thing. The first time people went over there
they spent a great deal of money, and effort, and time getting these data. And,
nobody has ever used the data, as far as I can tell.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Why do you think that is?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I don't know. Probably they
didn't think it through. Dick Carlson is the guy who went to Russia to do it,
and the last time I talked to him nobody had ever made any use of his work. And
he does a very good job of getting good data.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	It's very difficult
to persuade people, including the CEP, to think hard about what numbers they
want, to what accuracy, and why. You can say, "I want the density to two
percent accuracy over the range." Then I come back and say, "Why?
What are you going to do with those numbers? That's very expensive. If you
really mean you want that accuracy, I probably would want to run three different
tools. But, you probably don't really mean that, because you're not going to
use those numbers that accurately."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Each person, each
organization will say, "I need this measurement," and they will
always specify some accuracy which is good as they could possibly use, without
ever thinking how difficult they make it to get the data, and how much more costly
it is, and how it's competing with someone else's desires. You really have to
think about what you're going to do with those numbers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Let me say, the CEP
doesn't need accurate numbers. They're just talking about how their grandfather
did it, and 10% accuracy would be wonderful for them. We put big error bars on
the data we present, and nobody cares.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, in defense of the CEP, I
constituted a subcommittee of the CEP a number of years ago, chaired by Bill Twenhofel.
It was called the Data Needs Subcommittee. That subcommittee came back and said
the CEP didn't need various kinds of data. The Laboratories paid no attention
at all, and continued to get those data anyway. Why? Well, they've got guys
like Joe Hearst, and John Rambo, and Fred App who are calculating various things,
and they want numbers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's right. Calculators need
numbers. But I think we are getting data that are too accurate. Or too precise &ndash;
they are probably not that accurate. I think we are wasting time with too many
decimal places which nobody uses.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You now have a tool that
measures the hydrogen in the rock, and you assume all the hydrogen is there as
water, so let's say you measure the water in the rock. Why did you develop a
tool to do that?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: We didn't. We hired it. That's
the tool that was available. But also, one of the important parameters for
containment is the total water. That's one of the key parameters, and if you
need to know numbers at all, that's one of the numbers you need to know. When
we first started we looked at the available methods of measuring water content,
and decided this was the best. But we didn't want to measure only free water.
We'll continue to report total water and these other parameters, the porosity
and saturation, which the whole world tries to measure, by the way. The
objective of the industry in running all these logging tools is to measure porosity
and saturation. That's what the tools are built for; that's what they were
invented for. All those methods assume that the formation is saturated with
some conductive liquid.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	We looked at density
tools, and we just demonstrated that these tools are worthless in the
seventeen-inch holes for the groundwater characterization program. We've shown
that they're not good. For 20ax we had problems with a density tool in a seventeen-inch
hole, and we had to build a new calibrator for it. This was blocks of various
metals like aluminum and magnesium. That's the way you calibrate a density
tool, and that's one reason density tools are much easier to calibrate. We
discovered that these automatic, two-receiver compensated density tools get
wrong answers if they are tilted ever so slightly in a seventeen-inch hole. They
work all right in an eight-inch hole, which is what they were designed for, but
they have to be recalibrated for the bigger holes. That's still being worked,
but we have now demonstrated what we surmised on 20ax;<i class="calibre13"> </i>the logs are
coming out wrong.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The first log I see at the CEP
is the density log. You measure that with a gamma ray logging too/. What
happened to the dry-hole acoustic log?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It is used, and in fact you see
it, but you just don't pay attention. It's the DHAL, and it's shown every time
we show logs. It's the acoustic velocity. First comes the caliper log, and then
comes the dry hole acoustic. That's something we invented ourselves, because
there were none in the world. We needed it for Plowshare at the time, because
we had no way of measuring acoustic velocity except by seismic surveys.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	We went to Don
Rawson's back yard one day, with a couple of acoustic transducers. Dick Carlson
and I had thought of attaching cones to transducers that we had bought. We put
them on Rawson's fireplace, and sure enough, we got a signal through the
fireplace, horizontally. Then we tried it on trees, as well. We got acoustic signals,
and we had invented a dry-hole acoustic log. The reason nobody in the world
uses it is because it's not continuous. A logging tool to be useful in the
industry, where drilling costs are immense, must run continuously as you pull
it up the hole. There are now a couple of logs that do that, but there weren't
at the time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Why isn't your acoustic log
continuous?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Because it has to dig into the
wall of the hole. You have to push it hard up against the wall, and push these
points into the wall. That's why nobody else ever invented it. It wasn't that
we were these brilliant geniuses; it was just that nobody else could use it in
their business.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Then we discovered a
problem with it, which is why we call it a relative measurement. In a small
hole it agrees quite well with seismic measurements of velocity. In a big hole
it usually gives us velocities that are too low. The reason for this,
apparently, is that the material near the wall of a big hole, or any hole, is
broken up by the drilling process. In the case of a big hole the depth to which
it is broken up is about the same as the depth to which the acoustic signal
goes, so we're just measuring the region which is broken up by the drilling
process.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The least time path
is what you measure. So, the higher velocity material gives you less time, but
if you have to go through a large amount of low velocity material to get to the
high velocity material, that doesn't work. The way we proved all this was to
build a tool with two receivers, which is the standard way done in the industry.
If we used the measurement between the last two receivers, it was faster than
between the source and one receiver. That's because the passage through the
broken up material is cancelled out. Actually, in the industry now they may use
up to twenty receivers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	So, we get the
acoustic velocity, and then the density, which we get from the gamma log, and
then we show the acoustic impedance, which is the product. And that's probably
why we still show that log - to show the impedance mismatches.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	For the water content
we use the epithermal neutron log, and correct for gap between the neutron
sonde and the wall of the hole. Los Alamos does not.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: So you ought to get different
answers, in the same hole.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Not only that, but if you look
at the calibration curves, they're different.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	And, we also show the
CO<sub class="calibre17">2</sub> content, which is still measured from samples. And we show the
clay content, which is done with x-rays, occasionally.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You also show the resistivity log.
How do you do that?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, resistivity is the
standard log in the oil industry. That was the first log invented, and it was
the only thing available for many years. You put a source of current at the
surface, and you look at the voltages generated by it, downhole. Nowadays I
think some of them have a source of current and voltage detectors in the hole.
Some of them use induction instead, because then there's no contact problem.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Again, it's very
difficult to do in big holes. In the big, dry holes none of the standard
methods work. We did one time develop an induction tool - huge coils for a big
hole - but we never made it standard. What we have for our dry hole resistivity
log, which is the only thing we can use in big, dry holes, is a bunch of wheels
- padded cloth wheels - saturated with copper sulphate solution . They roll up
the wall of the hole, and they're saturated with conductive solution. They make
contact with the wall of the hole. The basic problem is that sometimes they
make good contact, and sometimes they make bad contact as they roll up the
hole, and so you get indifferent results. That's our attempt at duplicating the
standard things that are used in liquid filled holes. The current source is in
one of the wheels, and you measure the voltage between the two wheels.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Why is it useful for the CEP?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, clay is conductive
because it's has water in it, and it's got all kinds of ions in it. So, clay is
more conductive than alluvium or tuff. Supposedly a resistivity log tells the
CEP if there is clay, but there have been a number of studies done, and none of
them link resistivity to clay. There have been a number of papers which show
there is really no connection. Nevertheless, since we care very much about clay
because of Baneberry, it is traditional to present a resistivity log, and to
worry very much if there is a very low resistivity somewhere. Then you have to
go get a sample, despite the fact that Gayle Palawski has written a couple of
papers showing the lack of connection between log resistivity and clay content.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The log resistivity
is proportional to the conductivity of the rock, which depends, among other
things, on the amount of water, the amount of clay, and the kind of rock. But
it depends even more, I believe, on the amount of contact between these wheels
and the wall of the hole. There are many brand names of these resistivity, or
electric, or E logs. And there are many configurations of the electrodes,
depending on who does it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: How about the seismic velocity.
How is that measured?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I got into that when I first
got into logging. The way it's measured now is with an air gun. There has been
a lot of work on that, and I don't know too much about how it's done today. There
are problems with getting good contact between the air gun and the rock. The
air gun puts a big pulse into the ground, at the surface, and you have
detectors clamped into the hole, downhole, and they sense the signal. So,
you're measuring the entire depth of the hole, down to the detector.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: So if I want to know the
velocity in a particular layer I have to subtract out all the others above it.
It sounds as though the deeper I go the worse the measurement would get.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, this is an acoustic
signal, not going through liquid, and you measure the arrival time of this
acoustic signal, The signal has to be some amplitude that you can see.
Therefore, the arrival time really depends on the contact between the detector
and the wall. You look at the analog trace, and you pick the arrival time. If
you have less sensitivity you will see the signal later, because the signal is
not a step function; it rises from zero to full value in some amount of time,
and when you can see the arrival depends on the sensitivity of the detector.
It's a smoothly rising signal, and you pick the time when you can see it.
That's the trouble with automatic picking procedures; they depend on the
amplitude.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	So, from all this,
the measured velocity depends on the contact between the detector and the wall.
Again, this is a problem with our dry holes, which is not much of a problem in
industry, where they have liquids and the contact doesn't matter.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There are other logs, one of
which is presented to the CEP as the gravimeter. Tell me about that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: A gravimeter is a device that
measures gravity, and it's used routinely in the industry to make subsurface
maps. I got interested in borehole gravity when it was first being thought
about in the 1950's. The first paper was published in 1950, and I was one of
the first people to use it for anything.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The tool measures
gravity in different places, and you attribute variations to changes that are
underground. The idea of measuring rock density with borehole gravity was very
intriguing to me, and as soon as a borehole gravity meter became available I
started using one to measure density that way. You put the tool downhole, and measure
at various stations at various depths, and you can calculate the density of
uniform slabs, if you assume the world is made up of uniform slabs.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	That's exceedingly
uninteresting, but if you measure the difference between the gravity
measurements and the density log, and you believe them both, you can infer
things about the structure of the earth, underground. And that's what it's used
for. There's now a fair industry; I was at a large meeting in Chicago last year
where people were talking about improving the measurements. There were maybe
twenty or thirty experts there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The changes you are looking for
in the gravitational field must be very small, and so the instrument must be
very sensitive.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It is a very sensitive
instrument. One of the questions raised at this meeting was, "Do we need
greater sensitivity?" The conclusion was that the instrument is sensitive
enough to do the job. Basically, it has a mass on an arm, and it measures the
angle of the arm as the field changes. That's the physics principle; the trick
is to get it to work in real life. People have done this, and there's one company
that does it well. The interesting conclusion of that meeting was that what
they wanted was to make the measurement faster, and make the equipment more
rugged and more reliable. But they didn't need more sensitivity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: How do you infer things about
the structure?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You make a calculational model
of the structure, calculate what the gravity would be with that model, from
that calculate the difference in gravity that you would see at different depths,
and compare that to what you observe. There are, of course, infinitely many
structures that would give you the same result, and all you can do is to use
the measurements to choose between proposed models.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	It has apparently
worked very well in the oil industry to find oil some distance from a hole.
Again, their density logs are much more accurate than ours, because they
satisfy all the assumptions &ndash; good contact with the hole, no gap, and it's a
small hole. They can use very small density differences to infer useful things.
We can't, because our measurements aren't that good because of our big, rough
holes. But that's what we use it for.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	There is also a thing
called a gravity gradient measurement, where you're measuring the change in
gravity with depth. You can build instruments which measure the gradient, but
it turns out that gravity measurements are sensitive to one over R squared of
the mass. The gradient measurement is sensitive to one over R cubed, and the
gradiometer is so sensitive to changes in the hole configuration and things
like that, that you don't buy anything by building a gradiometer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What's the free air gradient
that is always measured when you're doing gravity measurements?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: If you calculate the density, using
a gravity meter, there is a constant term, an additive constant, that is in the
formula for the gravimetric density. It is the change in gravity with depth which
is caused by the fact that you're getting closer to the center of the earth.
It's called the free air gradient because originally it was the change in
gravity measured as you got closer to the surface of the earth, in the air.
When we started working with this, we decided we ought to measure this free air
gradient by making gravity measurements on a tower. Well, a lot of people in
the field said that was a bad way of doing it, because that measurement is very
sensitive to things that are close to the surface. In fact, that measurement is
now used to look for tunnels and things like that which are near the surface.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	You get a much better
measurement of the free air gradient by measuring the gravity at the surface
over a wide area, and doing a transformation to calculate the free air
gradient. Norm and I finally got persuaded by a number of publications by other
people that is indeed the correct way to do it. We were not doing it right, and
so we now do it that way. We no longer measure it directly. If you're making
measurements near the surface, yes, you should measure it above the surface.
But when you're measuring at depth, as we are, in general you're better off by
calculating it from a number of surface measurements.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Incidentally, one of
the things you have to correct for is tide, and the first time I asked for tide
tables for the Nevada Test Site people thought I was crazy. If you set a
gravity meter out on the ground, it changes with time, because the sun and the
moon affect it. There are earth tides, and that's what you have to correct for.
That's automatic now.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The seismic survey
business is another huge industry, and it's been a very successful one. The
surveys show you where reflecting layers are, below the surface. I have never
been able to interpret the measurements with any comfort. I think it requires a
great deal of imagination to interpret those surveys, but people do it
successfully, and get paid very well for it. It is a universally used
procedure, and that's how all this information we get about the structure of
the earth comes to us.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	It is another
technique which is standard in the oil industry, but which is exceedingly
difficult to use at the Test Site. The highly porous rocks near the surface are
highly absorbing for the acoustic signals. We used to hear stories of how some
world expert in seismic measurements would come to the Test Site and go out
with our technician. The expert would start setting off small explosions and get
no signal. Finally our technician would say, "You have to use two sticks
of dynamite instead of one detonator to get a signal here." For many years
companies would come out and produce thick reports about why they failed .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Norm Burkhard got his
Morrison Award because he was the first person to do a successful seismic
survey at the Test Site. He used a procedure which I don't quite understand,
where he used a fairly small charge. He got it to work; it had to do with using
the right source-detector spacing, and the right type of charge, and all sorts
of things like that, which he said he learned in school.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	It is difficult
technique to use at the Test Site, but we do have seismic surveys now, and they
are used usually to look at cross sections, to interpret them. A number of them
have been done, but nothing like the number that have been done in the oil
patch. They're quite expensive, but you can call in a crew, and they'll do it.
My problem is in interpreting them, but people do it. You can see things, but
figuring out what they mean is another story. Now again, there's a huge amount
of software that's been developed to improve these things, and there's all kinds
of difficulties converting time, which is what you measure, to distance, which
is what you want.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	By the way, another
way people in the industry measure porosity is velocity. These velocity logs in
industry, in the right circumstances, get porosity from velocity, if you make
the right assumptions. In a clean, water filled sandstone, all you need is the velocity.
As far as I know, every formula that's used assumes clean, water filled
sandstone. So, a velocity log is called a porosity tool, and that's what it was
developed for. There was recently an issue of one of the journals published on
the use of velocity logs to infer porosity and permeability and things like
that in rocks like granite. Now people are starting to measure fractures with
velocity. You can do all kinds of neat things with acoustic signals, in a water
filled hole. You can actually make a picture of the wall of the hole and look
at the fractures, and things like that. You can even see some depth into the
wall, and see fractures.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: One of the things people on the
Panel, from time to time, ask about is the stress state of the rock, and about
the shear strength. What can be done there?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: We are, in fact, developing a
method of measuring strength, compressional strength. I have spent a fair
amount of time, from time to time, trying to figure out how to do that downhole.
I have not yet found a method we could field. There are methods that I have
looked at that are used, even some that are done in the tunnels, that are very
difficult to do remotely. For example, putting two pins in the wall of the
hole, measuring the distance between them very accurately somehow, then taking
a saw and making a slot in the wall between those two pins, and then measuring the
distance between them again. We've spent some money looking at things like
that. One of the major problems is that the borehole causes a major change to
the in-situ stress, and so whatever you measure in the wall of the borehole may
not have a great deal to do with what's out in the rock. But we've looked at a
number of methods for that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I think of it because one of
the things people are touting these days, maybe correctly, maybe not, is the
following argument. There isn't, necessarily, any residual stress field around the
cavity. There would be in a uniform medium, or world, but we don't shoot shots
in such a world. Blocks move, here and there, and what really contains shots is
hydrofractures, which drive out into the rock a short distance, dump a lot of
steam, cool the cavity down, and that's it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's quite possible. Now, we
have worked on measuring shock induced stress. In fact, we just had a failure
on the Bristol event, where we got numbers that were mostly strain. It is exceedingly
difficult to measure shock induced stress. Part of the problem is that the
shock damages the gauges. The biggest problem is that it's very easy to measure
a stress in the stress transducer, but relating that to the stress in the rock
is very difficult indeed. If you could, in fact, put the transducer in direct,
intimate contact with the rock, you could do it. But you can't. You have to
drill a hole, you have to put the transducer in a package, you have to put the
package is some kind of stemming material, and all of that makes a big difference
in the measurement. We've worked quite hard on that. We've developed procedures
for reducing the data, and they haven't worked very well either.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: How about measurements where
you could say, "Yes, there is a residual stress field, because before the
shot I measured the stress in this region, and thirty seconds after the shot, here's
what that stress field was, and it was different."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: We've had some little hints of
that in these measurements, but one of the major problems is that every stress
transducer you can build is also affected by strain. You can't distinguish between
stress and strain easily, and so we have not been able to prove that what we
have seen is actually residual stress. We have seen signals that have stayed up
for long periods of time, but we can't prove what they are.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: As contrasted to post-shot
stress, there is a lot of interest, by people who are interested in the
hydrofracing model, in in-situ stress.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Attempts have been made, and
papers have been published, even about work at the Test Site. Again, it's
something that's done routinely in small holes in mines, where you can get at the
rock, where you can drill a small hole and put an instrument in it. Even then
there are difficulties.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	While we have not
developed a method for measuring in-situ stress remotely, we are developing a
method to measure strength. It's very difficult, again, to calibrate. It is
known that the penetration of a projectile into a material, such as a rock,
depends on the strength of the rock, among other things. We did a series of experiments
in concretes, and things like that, where we demonstrated this. And, there's
been a great deal of work done on it because of penetrating weapons, by Sandia
and Waterways Experiment Station. They have developed a whole bunch of
complicated formulas for calculating the penetration.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I discovered that a
formula developed in 1765, or something like that, by Euler, was much better
than any of the formulas developed in modern times, and he used very simple
math. At any rate, we now have a device, built, which is capable of being put
down hole. It fires a projectile into the wall of the hole, by remote control,
measures the deceleration, and then retracts. It can then be used to repeat.
This device exists, but the equipment to lower it down the hole doesn't exist.
There are a lot of difficulties with it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	One of the major
problems, of course, is in calibration. You can calibrate it in concrete fine,
and that's what we're working on. Calibrating it in rock is extremely
difficult. We're going to take it down to the tunnels, and we've done this once
before with a kluge. Now we're doing it with the real apparatus. The problem,
of course, is knowing the right answer. When you fire it into a rock, and measure
the deceleration, what is the strength of that rock? You get a core sample, and
you measure the strength of that core sample. You hope that if you measure it
six inches from the place you're measuring with the tool that it is at least
similar. But if you take two or three core samples, and you measure the
strength of them, they're wildly different. And if you shoot in two or three
places in this piece of rock, you get different penetrations. I think we'll be lucky
if we get a factor of two accuracy; we'll be happy if we get a factor of two
accuracy. But this tool I am very pleased with. It's calibrating pretty well in
grouts, and I'm looking forward to doing it this summer in the tunnels. It's a
lovely piece of apparatus.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Maybe the strength varies by a
factor of two over short distances.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Hearst</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Quite possibly. At any rate, we
have actually built this apparatus, which is on wheels at the moment. We have
designed a device to lower it. It's designed to work in a big hole, to clamp up
against the wall of a big hole and fire the projectile into the wall.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	John Rambo uses the
drilling rate as a measure, of some kind, of the strength, but it also measures
other properties. Among other things it depends on how the drillers are
working, and how much weight is on the bit, and how sharp the bit is. But it is
another measure.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	John also believes
that the velocity is another measure of the strength. Remember that I told you
that the velocity depends on how much the rock is broken up by the drilling?
Well, if it's broken up less, it's stronger, and so the velocity is higher. A
lot of other things will make the velocity higher also. We may have to use all
of these methods together to infer a strength. But since strength makes a great
deal of difference in a calculation, it's important to get it.</span></p>

<h2>Chapter 8: Energy Coupling and Partition</h2>
<br>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nuclear detonation produces ten
to the twelfth calories per kiloton, by definition. All of that energy is
deposited in the earth, and ultimately, over a long period of time, results in
making the earth as a whole somewhat warmer. Over the short term, the energy deposition
can cause many different things to take place. The question of what that energy
deposition does, and what fraction goes into each phenomenon is an open one, subject
to many variables. Some amount causes surrounding rock to vaporize and to melt.
Another amount causes the surrounding material to move, giving rise to motions
in the ground. Some causes open pores to collapse, some gives rise to stresses
in the rock, some is carried away by elastic waves that propagate to large
distances. The amount of the energy that goes into each of the various channels
determines the phenomena that are produced by the detonation. Some are easily seen;
that which goes into the seismic wave can be detected worldwide. The amount
that melts rock stays close to the origin; the rock cools, solidifies, and can
only be seen if a costly reentry is made to the vicinity of the detonation
point.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;App</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When you are looking at the
coupling of the energy, and ground motions, there is the issue of how much
energy actually gets coupled into the rock, as opposed to what remains behind
in the cavity. This deals with the shock Hugoniot and the release properties of
the vaporized rock. Butkovitch, in 1974, determined that there are large
differences in the kind of energy coupling between low and high density rock.
He looked at the refractories in the melt puddle and assumed perfect mixing,
and from that inferred how much melt had been generated. That gave a value for
how much energy had stayed behind in the cavity. What he showed was that for a
dense rock you get twice as much, or maybe more than twice as much, of the
energy into the shock wave as you do for a shot in low density, like 1.6 grams
per cc, rock. And so, starting off one looks like a bigger bomb than the other,
but it doesn't really change the waveform characteristics, just the amplitude
of the signal. It looks like a bigger bomb.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the porosity,
and a number of other things change how large the bomb appears to be; how much
energy goes into the solid rock. One can make the argument that there could be
a factor of two in how much energy goes into the stress wave, just from the Butkovitch
work. We should be able to go back and systematically look at cortex data to
determine the hydrodynamic coupling for different materials. That's essentially
what cortex is sampling - the energy that goes into the shock wave. If we could
combine that with additional rad chem analyses of melt puddles, we might be
able to come up with some relationship between such coupling and the working
point material.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part is, as
we move farther out, there's this other phase of coupling, where the strength
of the materials comes into effect and changes both the wave shape and the
amplitude. That's the regime where the properties of the rock can modify the
wave form to make it look like maybe something else, another type of source.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Does that matter to
containment?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;App</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I think it matters. Anything we
can learn about how much energy gets coupled into the ground, and how it gets
coupled in, I think is relevant to containment. If a bomb is going to put twice
as much energy into ground shock because it's in this material rather than in
that one, that's relevant. It's relevant to containment because we worry about
the yield of the bomb, and that's the yield of the bomb, as far as the ground
shock is concerned.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There was a recent tunnel
experiment that was identical in almost every respect to a test that had been
fired six months before. The results show that the same explosive yield, in the
same configuration, created a seismic signal that was one-half as large, or
even a little bit less than half as large, in one case as in the other. That
doesn't disturb anyone, because everyone knows that the seismic wave is kind of
a vague and various thing. But when people began to examine the close-in strong
motion measurements, they too were half as large, or less. And, as were the
accelerations, as was the tunnel damage. If you went to a distance like a
hundred meters from each of these two explosions, in one case there was nearly
total destruction of everything. The tunnel was collapsed, and so forth. In the
other case there was almost no observable effect; there were displacements, but
they were modest.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the data are
examined, one of the suggestions, and it looks now to me to be the most likely
suggestion, is that the mechanisms for coupling energy, in that region where
melting and vaporization was going on, was very different in the two cases. If
you think of the total explosion, very close to the explosion rock is melted
and heated to extremely high temperatures. So, there is a part of the total
explosion energy that goes into heating the immediate surroundings, and that
part goes into forming the cavity. There's another fraction of the total energy
that goes into deformation of the rock in an elastic-plastic sense. And
finally, way out at longer distances, there's an elastic wave which creates a
seismic wave.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've long said that
about fifty percent or so of the total bomb energy goes into the thermal cavity
region, that another large fraction, also about fifty percent, goes into the
plastic deformation region, and a very tiny part - one percent or less - goes
into the seismic signal. What these two shots, and the measurements since then,
suggest is that this roughly equal partition between the molten and the plastic
deformation is variable, and a lot more variable than we thought. And that, in
turn, affects the one percent or so that's left over for the seismic wave by a
rather large factor.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, look at
the amount of energy that is stored in what we call the containment cage. Take
from one cavity radius to three cavity radii and say that is the containment
cage region. That's a very crude set of definitions, but if you put two bars of
stress in that spherical shell, that amounts to thirty percent of the initial
device energy, using the compression curves that we are measuring. That amount
of energy in the containment cage is a significantly large fraction of the
device energy, and things that go on to perturb it are big things, not little
things.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What would lead to variability
between the ratio of device energy that goes into cavity formation and the
elastic-plastic type of deformation?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There are quite a lot of
things, it turns out. We have started to look at that, but I don't think the
subject has been adequately studied, certainly not exhaustively. The most
obvious thing that changes the ratio is irreversible pore collapse. Suppose you
built the test medium out of fiberglass foam, or frothy pumice-like blocks,
with fifty percent air-filled void. The crushing of those voids would consume
huge amounts of energy. Of course, the material gets very hot when it's
compressed, but we don't measure temperature from a distance, so we don't know
how hot it gets. All we know is how much of the compressive wave got
transmitted, and if you're crushing the material, you're not transmitting any wave.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, air-filled voids
are one thing that can change the ratio. There are other kinds of things, such
as phase transitions. Everybody is familiar with the ice cube in the drink, and
the fact that you have a phase transition going on. It keeps the drink cold
even though there is almost no volume change. The same thing happens in an even
more pronounced way in some solids, like rocks. There are phase transitions
that go on where minerals hydrate, or dehydrate, or melt, or vaporize, or
change from loose open structures to dense compact structures. A common one is
the transition of carbon to diamond, where there is a big density change.
Silica does the same thing. It goes from an orthorhombic eightfold symmetry to
cubic symmetry at very high pressures, and the volume change that accompanies
that is like a factor of two. So the amount of energy that can be stored, just
by going from an open loose structure to a high density structure is huge.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You mean that just to
generically call the Rainier Mesa rocks 'tuff' doesn't tell you what you need
to know?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Right, and it doesn't even tell
you what you need to know if you identify it as being Tunnel Bed Four, because
it turns out that the degree of zeolitization, the minerals of Tunnel Bed Four,
are quite different in different places.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: So, to say that you have Tunnel
Bed Four here, and in a different location you also have Tunnel Bed Four, as
the geologists do, is not adequate to determine what's going to happen when the
device goes off, at least close-in.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's a conclusion that
appears to be true. I've got an analogy, which isn't exact. The business of
containment, the interaction of a nuclear explosion with the earth, is somewhat
like atomic physics was at the turn of the century. People were beginning to
discover the difference between the orbital electrons in the various atoms.
Then they discovered there was a nucleus, and there was the atomic structure.
Then there is the nuclear structure, and they discovered that makes a difference;
all nuclei aren't just the same nuclei. There are levels in those nuclei and
there are particles in there. And then, there are particles in the particles. I
think that going from the picture of the earth as homogeneous is just like the
transition when they said, "You know, the atom isn't a pudding. It's more
complicated than that."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're at the point of
knowing things are more complicated, but not exactly what all of the
complications are. That is still an open question. It's not open to the degree
that we don't have some pretty good containment rules, but it is open to the
degree that we can't say we can test in every conceivable situation with
complete certainty. There are questions that have to be answered in every case.
I think we can answer them. I don't see any insurmountable technological
problems, but it's more complicated than we first thought, by quite a bit .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of melt is
one of the interesting numbers to look at. I really do believe, and I think
most of us in the business believe, that energy is conserved. Ten to the
twelfth calories in a glacier, or in the Greenland ice cap, will melt a fixed
amount of ice, and it doesn't make a lot of difference if it does it by
crushing or whatever. One of the rules of thermodynamics is that the paths are
not important; the end states will be the same no matter what path you take.
There is a certain amount of ice transformed into a certain amount of water. If
you know the total energy, you know the total amount of water regardless of the
path.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you consider
those kinds of things, and then you observe such different results in the
seismic signal from two different events, you have to say, "It's clear
that there have been differences in the thermodynamic path, and that must be
related to the materials involved, and in the structure." We know that the
total has to be the same.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the differences
between P tunnel, and N and T tunnel. N and T turn out to be almost twins, but
P is different. When we ask the question, "Well, what is different?"
what turns out to be different is the degree of zeolitization, although the
stratigraphic units are the same. That's a fancy way of saying to what degree
the original volcanic glass has been transformed into some kind of a clay mineral.
There are units in both tunnels that have the same amount of clay formation,
but the clay occurs at different levels in the stratigraphic section. In other
words, the geologists have layered the cake differently than the physics does.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There was a man, Rick Warren,
who gave a presentation at one of the CEP meetings about identifying the rock structures
by mineral analysis. He felt that was the way you should identify the layers.
His didn't correspond to the conventional units, but his point was that he
could tell you that the rock at this depth in this hole is like that rock at a
different depth in that hole.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Right. DNA
had him to do a special set of examinations, and it was through his work that
this analysis of the P tunnel versus N tunnel came out. There are like fivefold
differences in the amounts of some of the minerals.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Might one
say, “Over and over again we learn that the earth is an inhomogeneous body of
materials. There's no reason to be surprised by differences in the response of
the rocks to shots in different locations, because if you don't think of the
rocks just as Tunnel Beds Four, and instead look at their mineralographic
makeup, you're in a different medium in those locations?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's
right. That's what you would conclude. And that has to do with the history of
the two areas we've been trying to understand, and their history with water.

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first years of underground
testing the radiochemists had a difficult time determining the fraction of the
yield that resulted from the fusion reactions. The samples obtained from the
post-shot drill-backs sufficed for measuring the number of fission reactions, but
the number of fusion reactions was difficult problem. In this circumstance
other methods of measuring the yield, or energy release, of the device were
sought.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield could, in principle, be
determined by measuring the velocity of the outgoing shock wave in the earth
materials surrounding the device. Small diameter holes drilled near the
emplacement hole were used to place various instruments in, hopefully, known locations
with respect to the device so the shock velocity could be measured. information
about the behavior of the medium itself could also be determined by instruments
placed in the same satellite holes to measure the pressures and accelerations
produced by the shock as it passed</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the important tools for
obtaining information about shock velocities are what are called the
"slifer," and the "corrtex." In the slifer, a long length
of coaxial cable acts as the inductance in an oscillator circuit. When the
cable is placed in an environment where the cable is progressively crushed, and
thereby electrically shorted by some external pressure, the frequency of the
circuit changes. Measurement of the frequency of the oscillator as a function
of time will then give the rate at which the cable is being electrically
shortened. In the corrtex there is also a long length of cable, whose length is
determined by sending short electrical pulses down it and measuring the time it
takes for them to reflect from the shorted end.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I first got involved with
underground measurements when I was asked to head an instrumentation section to
make the close-in earth motion measurements on Scooter. We had stations at 25
feet, 50 feet, 100 feet, 200 feet, in vertical drill holes at shot depth. Then
we had some instruments above them, making some vertical measurements, and then
we had a few surface measurements. Scooter provided absolutely fantastic data
that probably is not equaled today.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Were these the first attempts
at such measurements?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass</span></b><span class="calibre10">: No. There were very good
measurements on Rainier. Bill Perret did those. Rainier was an outstanding
experiment and it was very well measured. Actually, some of the measurements
were fantastic. Go back and look at the work that Fran Porzell did. He had left
Los Alamos, and was at Armour Research at that time. He was attempting to
measure hydrodynamic yield. and he had measurements that are now on what I am
going to say is the cutting edge of what Los Alamos is now trying to do. There
was a Doppler system radar on Rainier to measure the shock wave arrival which actually
was as good, or just as far advanced, as Los Alamos is doing on the
hydrodynamic yield programs today.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on Scooter we
tried to make pressure measurements, and we got next to nothing. We put in a
few hydrophones, which are underwater pressure gauges, which we tried to adapt
to underground, in soil, measurements. These hydrophones, which were made by
Atlantic Research Corporation, were all Navy type equipment. They were a little
batch of barium titanate crystals, I think, in a sack, and they drove a cathode
follower, which was an emitter follower which drove a line driver. We tried to
put those in a pressure chamber, and tried to calibrate them. We then put the gauge,
which looked like your finger with a little bulb at the bottom, in a plastic
sack of sand. We then put this in a metal frame, lowered it down the hole, and
poured matching grout around it. The idea was that we would activate the
crystals in the chamber. The return was zero.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason the return
was zero was that during the long period of time when Scooter misfired, and
then finally went, we had snows and rains and everything else on the Test Site.
The emitter-follower boxes were right at the surface, and they all got wet, and
shorted out. As project officer I was at" fault for not having them moved.
That shot went about the first week of October, I believe, instead of July, for
reasons we have talked about.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Right after the moratorium I
was doing hydrodynamic yield measurements in satellite holes. Ray Blossom
picked the site for the shot, and Bob Newman told them how deep to drill the hole,
using his little scaling law. Then I came along and said, "Okay, let's
drill a hole here, and a hole there, and a hole over there, so for that yield
range I can measure the hydrodynamic yield."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to do that I
would go talk to the designers, and spend time with them. I would say,
"You've got this down as 10 kt. What's the chances it will go 15 kt?
What's the chances it will go five? What's the chance it will only give us a
hundred tons?" I would listen to everything I was told, and I would say to
myself, "Well, they say it's going to go ten, but it's clearly not going
to do that." So, I would locate the satellite holes so if it went three
kilotons I could get a good yield measurement. So, I'd have one or two in
close, and do the third one farther out. I would put the holes where I was guessing
would be right for the yields. We didn't have a design yield or a max cred
yield then. We had a design yield in the sense that they were hoping it would
give ten kt, or whatever. Newman would have the hole for that. But that's not
necessarily the yield I would use to place the satellite holes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: If you were trying to get the
yields hydrodynamically, that must have made the question of what the material
around the shot point was important to you.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Oh, yes. That's where I came up
with the four standards. There is a supersonic part of the arrival time curve,
then it becomes sonic. And so, the shot would tell me what the sonic velocity
of the material was. I had these curves, four altogether. I would say, "Is
the sonic velocity most like this one?" Then I would use that one to
derive the yield.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one shot the curve
would go sonic at this place, and then I could say, "This is very
wet." On another shot it would curve over at another place, and I could
say, "This is very dry." So, when I'd gotten enough facts I could
say, "There, that's what it does. The shot itself is telling me the sonic
velocity." So, I was able to construct a particular curve. Now, after
you've done that, you can go back and restructure all the other curves and say,
"Well, I can have any kind of equation of state here, depending on how much
water is there." Then you do the trial and error fitting, and let that try
to tell you the yield. I abandoned the four standard curves in time, but I
needed data to show me that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you're exactly
right. The reason I got interested in the water content, and what the rocks
were like, and the porosity, and whether the porosity was filled with water or
not, was in order to determine the yield. Hindsight says we were doing a better
job of determining the yields than we had any right to expect. They were really
pretty good, but I didn't know that. We finally stopped because the rad chem
people said they were getting the yields well enough. It costs money to drill
those satellite holes, so we finally stopped it. On the other hand, it's a good
way to get the yield, and you really can do a pretty good job in a medium that
you understand.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But remember, it's
the shot itself, when you shoot it, that tells you what the medium is like. We
never measured, ahead of time, the correct sonic velocity. We determined it from
the shot, and it was always different from the pre-shot measurement .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the point I
was trying to make at one of the CEP to these lads who were sitting there, who
persist in believing that what they measure is the truth. They insist upon
that, but it's never been true when you find out what the truth really is; it's
never right. But there's the, "That's what I went to school to learn. I
did all the things they told me to do, so this must be the number." So,
you're quite right. It was the hydrodynamic yield measurements for those earliest
shots, more than for containment, that forced me to understand something about
the material.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass</span></b><span class="calibre10">: After the moratorium Los Alamos
was drilling a lot of holes in Nevada. They would drill a hole, and we would
locate three satellite holes for making hydrodynamic yield measurements. Bob Brownlee
had a formula to locate them, and we were working in the sonic region, because
we thought that was the only place we could really understand. Also, in that
region we were far enough away that the range errors - the errors in distance
between where we thought the device was and where our instruments were -
weren't killing us. But, every now and then something would happen, and they
would end up putting a higher yield device down than they had originally
planned. So, we would be in the hydrodynamic region, and we started getting
some hydrodynamic data out of our first satellite hole, which was supposed to
have been at around ten kilobars. Sometimes we were getting up to a hundred kilobars,
or even two or three hundred kilobars.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bill Ogle said,
"Let's start this hydro yield program," he gave Sandia carte blanch.
Sandia and Los Alamos started their program, and Sandia did all the
experimental work on that. The people in Livermore went off on their own, and
started their own program. At one time Johnny Foster came to Sandia and asked Sandia
to get involved in the Livermore program, but it never got implemented. It was
probably a good thing, because I think there was too much work to be done as it
was.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It was expensive to drill those
instrument holes, and Livermore gave up such measurements as the chemists
developed their own methods for better yield measurements.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Los Alamos quit it too, because
we got into a medium that was badly layered and we weren't getting decent
results. The results were garbage, so we all quit the thing. But, before that
we did get some useful data. Our agreement was this - we would provide Los
Alamos with time of arrival information, if they would let us make, in their
facility, pressure measurements. Chabai and I wanted the pressure measurements.
They wanted the time of arrival data. Art Cox, Bob Brownlee, and I worked on
this constantly. I was at Los Alamos every week during that period.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were also working
rather closely with Fred Holzer at that time, on Madison. He had a big
containment program there. Madison had a huge room, and a drift off to the
side. He wanted to find out how the energy partitioned down that, and could you
close off the tunnel with that drift. He courteously invited us out to look at
the whole thing, and go over all his data.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he came up to us
at the CP one day and said, "I've got something you ought to get involved
with," and he handed us a drawing of the slifer that they had come up
with. We looked at it and said, "This is outstanding," because at
that time we were using peizoelectric crystals, rather than a cable. That's the
same thing the Russians are using today, although they finally went to a
slifer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We immediately
started putting down slifers. I think the first one went down within a week. I
took the drawing down to our trailer area, to an electronics guy, and said,
"Hey, build us one." He said, "I'm not going to put those tubes
down there," because it was a hard-tube oscillator. In about twelve hours
he had one working with two transistors. There's just an oscillator and a line
driver; that's all there is to it. That is still the same slifer design that
Sandia uses to this date. We have never changed that design, from that day in
the CP in 1962. When the Soviets looked at that they said, "You guys are
kidding. Is this how you measure hydrodynamic yield? You use this?" because
the transistors were circa '62.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We put slifers down
right away, and we loved them. We used them ten times as much as Livermore ever
did, and we still use them to this day. There are two slifers installed on the
outside of the pipe on all DNA events, to measure pipe flow.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brownlee and I put
them on the inside of a pipe one time only. Al Graves gave us Mataco, and said
we could do anything we wanted on Mataco, because he wanted to know if they
could do these line-of-sight experiments. One of the things we did was to put a
slifer cable inside the pipe, and one outside. We found that they read exactly
the same thing .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we started using
these slifers. Taking the slifer data, and the Hugoniots of the earth
materials, you can do the integrations, and put them all together, and you will
end up with a beautiful pressure-distance curve. And it matches the pressure
data. The whole thing falls together. It really falls together when you do it
for granite. You can end up with a pressure curve from two megabars down to two
hundred kilobars, in granite, from the slifer cables, that match the pressure
data. It's a very good test, and the sanity check is solid. Those all go
together, the pressure data, the slifer data, and everything else we've ever
put together.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we were making
these time-of-arrival measurements on Los Alamos events, and compiling the
data. That's one thing I've always done through the years. I say, "All
these individual data are poor, but when you put them together, there's some
sense to them." And Brownlee's a real advocate of this; you better believe
the data, because they're telling you something. They're always telling you something.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We started putting
together the data we had taken on the LASL shots where we were in the
hydrodynamic region and we discovered, 10 and behold, it didn't make any
difference what we were shooting in. There was a straight line function in
everything. If we were in granite, if we were in alluvium, if we were in tuff,
it made no difference in the strong shock region. All these materials worked the
same way. What we had found is now called the Universal Relation. Now, marble
is an exception. There are exceptions always to rules like that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this has been
ignored, I think for one reason. The Livermore jealousy concerning the Los
Alamos hydro yield program has been incredible. Livermore has been very negative
on that program from the very beginning, because they have been oriented more
toward seismic measurements for yield. So, they have not been much in favor of
the cortex measurement program and the slifer program.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, I think
cortex is the greatest sales job in the history of the program. If the Lord
above had told you how to do this, he would have said, "Cortex first, and
then slifer is the improvement over cortex," because slifer is continuous,
and cortex is discrete, and not too solid. Now, the new cortex gets rid of this
problem by looking for the phase change of a standing wave on a cable. Fran Porzell
had done that on Rainier. It didn't work on Rainier, but it was the same thing.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We first started the
idea of using slifers for hydrodynamic yield on the PNE and the Threshold Test
Ban Treaty, using this Universal Relation. It says that shock propagation in
most geologic materials can be described by one power-law formula. It's called
the Universal Relationship, or the Los Alamos Relationship. AI Chabai and I
developed it, and Los Alamos has used it ever since.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were pushing this
as the way to measure the yield of PNE events. The reason you have to use the
Universal Relationship on PNE's is that you don't know where the source is. The
treaty we had, and still do have, with the Soviet Union says that the canister can
be, then ten meters long, now twelve meters long. And, they can put the device
anywhere they want in those twelve meters.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You mean, you don't know where
the center of energy is.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bass</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's right. That's a better
way to put it. So, your system has to tell you where the center of energy is.
This is where you use the Universal Relation, because you know what the slope
of the function must be. All you have to do is make a measurement in the
emplacement hole, although it also works in a satellite hole. In the
emplacement hole you don't need to know where the source is below you, but you
do know from the Universal Relation that the slope of the shot curve has to be
a certain value. Theoretically it should be 0.4, on a log-log plot. It turns
out it 0.459, or something like that, because theory doesn't work here. It's
just strictly accidental empiricism, or quackery. That's a proper dictionary definition
of an empiric, isn't it - a quack? Anyhow, the Universal Relationship works
beautifully for this.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, that's where PNE
monitoring became possible, because we could, through the use of the Universal
Relationship, and with the proper spacing of the cable above the canister so we
would know we were in the hydrodynamic region, get the yield for any event we wanted
to measure. If you had a satellite hole that went deeper than the device
emplacement, that would tell you directly, but at that time there were not
going to be any satellite holes. Everything on the PNE treaty was main hole,
because it costs a million dollars to drill a satellite hole.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I was hired on, in November of
1963, by John Ellis, who was then in charge of a small group developing, as a
group, how to measure slifer yields for the nuclear test program. As I got familiar
with the operation I would design where they would be located. I was one of the
first people to say, "We've got to run the cable below the working point,
so we can see the first crush on it." We wanted the first arrival because
the elevation of that first arrival is where we thought the shot horizon would
be. That was of interest for us because it would tell where the working point
was, and there was a lot of uncertainty in that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You know where the emplacement
hole started, on the surface, and it may wander a bit, but not much. Then you
know where the device itself was put, rather accurately.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Fairly accurately, although in
the early days it wasn't always stated if they changed that location, and other
times that information did not get back to us. On the satellite holes we
thought the location accuracy was about two feet per thousand feet of depth, on
the average. The Sperry Sun people did those surveys. They would run two or
three runs, and we'd get different answers from each run. Two feet per thousand
feet was average, but it could exceed that. You could get systematically bad
information. Occasionally you'd get one survey that was five or six feet
different from the others.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there was some
uncertainty there. There was also some uncertainty in the depth, and there was
the distance from the emplacement hole to the satellite hole; you had to make
sure that was correct. One time I discovered that my data wouldn't fit no matter
what I tried to do to it. So I went back to an aerial photograph, found the
size of the pad, and then was able to determine how far away the satellite hole
was. The surveyors had made a ten foot error. Then I was able to analyze that
data. That was the kind of thing you could run up against from time to time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those days we were
usually using one satellite hole. There was one or two shots that had three
holes, but it was usually just one, and we didn't always know where the
satellite hole was. So, there were surveys, and sometimes there were errors in
where the cables might be located. So, we would make corrections after the fact
to our data.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: After people told you what the
yield was supposed to be?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I've been accused of that quite
often, so that question doesn't come as a surprise.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results were
quite sensitive to separation. A few feet made a difference. At the low yields
we were doing in those days, it was very sensitive. In fact, I could easily be
in the thirty to fifty percent range sometimes, certainly thirty percent. When
you made the statement that if I knew the yield I could determine a good slifer
yield, sometimes I did that, but more or less to determine what went wrong with
the experiment. I was looking for systematic problems. I'd look back at the
yield, and I'd say, "In order to get this yield, what would I have needed
to change?" And so I would learn something about the experimental
procedure, hopefully, to improve it. But I can't say I was completely oblivious
to the fact that I sometimes knew what the yield was before I published the
yield that I had gotten.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: If you were going to do that
kind of measurement, you needed to know something about the material properties
of the medium in which you were shooting - whether it was tuff, or alluvium, or
below the water table, or whatever. How did you get that kind of information?
When you started the slifer measurements they weren't logging the holes were
they?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: We weren't getting anything.
The geologists would go down, look at the cuttings, and say things like,
"There's rocks down there," or, "This is highly porous
stuff". They weren't very good descriptions for what I needed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had four or five
curves that we would compare our data to, to get the yield. It's called similar
explosion scaling. These curves were labeled Wet, Damp, Dry, Very Dry. The tail
of these curves would fold over flatter if they were dry, and they would be
steeper at the end if they were wet. I would take these curves, and I would compare
the tails of these things after the fact, and with some knowledge that we were
in a wet hole or a dry hole area, I would ask the geologists for what specific
information they had. From that I would try to figure out which curve was the
one I was to use. It is not the best way, and it is certainly not as good a way
as we do nowadays.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Bob Brownlee did measurements
of that sort for some time for Los Alamos. Did you have any contact with him at
all?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: No, I don't think so; not in
those days. The curves I was just mentioning came from Los Alamos, and they had
come from calculations they had done. We inherited those nomenclatures. We were
at least self-consistent in terms, between the Laboratories.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Why did you use satellite
holes, which are expensive? Why not put the slifer cables down the emplacement
hole?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: We did. We did them in both
places, but what was happening during those days was we were usually measuring
fairly low yields, and there were often large diagnostic line-of-sight pipes, at
that time. Close in to the device, where you needed to be with the slifer
cables, there was a lot of radiation and energy that was going up to hit
doghouses and things like that. Often what I'd see on the slifer cables was
doghouses exploding. I could see all this detail going on, but it wasn't very
conducive to doing a good yield measurement. So, I kept pushing for satellite
holes. That was an additional expense, and I think toward the end of this early
era they were trying to save money, and the other methods of yield determination
were getting better, so slifers sort of ceased to exist at Livermore, probably
around 1964 to 1965.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What's the difference between a
slifer and a cortex measurement?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Really nothing, in terms of
what the data looks like. In a slifer, the cable is the inductive leg of a
tuned oscillator. When the shock crushes the cable, and shorts it, the
inductance changes, which changes the oscillator frequency. Los Alamos, at a
later time, decided to use a slightly different way to measure the cable
length. What they would do was send an electrical signal down the cable, let it
reflect off the crush point, and come back. So, they would measure the transit
time. This is what the cortex method is. Essentially we measured the same
thing, but by slightly different methods.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some things
that a slifer does in sensing a change more rapidly in the speed of the crush
going up the cable, because you don't have to wait for the transit time of the
signal. There are some advantages to the slifer, and they're still being used
on the tunnel shots. I am not sure which method is better. I think cortex is a
little bit freer of noise, and in some instances, because the technology of
electronics have changed, it's better in that sense. It suffers from the same
problems we had in the early days of doing slifers. It's just that when they
brought more information to bear on the problem in these recent times, it's a
little easier to get better solutions from the data. But there are still problems
that are very hard to deal with .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have looked at a
lot of data where I would see a time of arrival up above the device which
seemed shorter than it did off on the horizontal, where we were looking at the
horizontal arrival of the shockwave. Then after a while, the two curves from
those locations would come together. This was two separate cables, of course. I
saw that more often than not. If there was a baffle, or some sort of metal
plate, or something like that above the device, it looked like the shock was
coming from that source. Or if there was a large opening for a brief distance
above the device you could almost see that looking like a source.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there was this
problem of where the center of energy looked like it was, very close-in. People
like to measure close-in, near the center; the material properties don't matter
as much there because of the very high pressures. But what does matter is the minute
geometry of what's going on with the explosion, in terms of where the energy
flows. So, you've got a trade-off taking place at that point. It's almost
better to look at the data farther out, but at that point you're worried about
material properties more.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you looked at the
entire curve on these things, sometimes you could determine what errors you
were looking at. If your cable was further down than you thought it was, you
could see that kind of error, because it was a constant difference from what
you should be reading. And if you were comparing it to an emplacement hole, sometimes
you could determine that. If the satellite hole were farther away than you
thought, you could compare it to the emplacement hole, and sometimes you would
get a feel for that kind of an error. These were all techniques, and some of
them I had developed in the early days, like looking at where the first crush point
was on the satellite hole to try and iron out some of those difficulties. A lot
of that is now taking place more professionally with current methods than I was
able to do.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth in which the energy of
the detonation is deposited is not an infinite, homogeneous material,
unfortunately for those who would calculate and predict what will occur. The
various layers of rocks of different properties, the faults, the presence or
absence of water all affect the ground response. One example is the surface ground
motion produced by an event called Tybo, which was detonated in an emplacement
hole in Pahute Mesa. The surface motion, and the measured ground shock was,
unexpectedly, the highest that had ever been seen at the Test Site. John Rambo
tried to model the geologic setting, and in his calculations determine why this
should have been so.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I started to wonder about these
peculiar ground motions when there were two shots that were fired quite close together
physically, and also in time. One was nine kilotons, and it was located below
the water table at about six hundred and eighty-eight meters. The upper one was
at about four hundred and thirty some meters, and it was about thirty-five
kilotons. The interesting thing was that the free surface velocity for the
deeper one was about one point one meters per second, and the free surface
velocity for the upper one, which was higher in yield and much closer to the surface,
was about one meter per second. These were actually measured, and because there
was about thirty seconds between the detonations it was easy to see separate
signals.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The thirty-five kilotons closer
to the surface gave less motion than the nine kilotons deeper down?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's right. And so, that was
certainly a puzzle.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: No puzzle. The lower one was
below the water table. The coupling is higher there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: But above the water you had all
this porous material, for quite a ways. The shock was running through much more
porous material from the more deeply emplaced lower yield shot than the shock
was from the upper yield shot. The perception at that time was that this was
something to wonder about.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out, from what we saw in
the calculations, that being below the water table tended to give what I call a
focusing effect that changed the attenuation rate of the signal, even though
you're going through the same porous material. The shock is being absorbed right
above the water table; there is quite a lot of attenuation at that point. But
there is another effect. The shape of the wave shows where it comes from, or
where it looks like it comes from, and that is important. If it becomes more
planer, it's going to attenuate less than the spherical wave you get if
everything is a uniform medium.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't know this until we did
the Tybo shot. That was an event that had very high ground motion. It was about
nine point eight meters per second.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That is the highest ground
motion we have ever seen on a contained shot in Nevada, if I remember
correctly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's right. Tybo was
certainly a mystery because of the high ground motion. There was at one time
some TV footage of what it looked like from the side, when it went off. It
showed this huge mound rising up, and you could see the curvature quite
clearly. The containment scientist related to me that it looked like it was going
to come out of the ground. It just looked like a cratering shot, and gave you
that impression, it was so rounded.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there was a lot of interest
in why this could have occurred . I went back and I ran fifty or more 1-0
calculations, and I couldn't get anything close to what happened, no matter
what I did. Even if I ran it saturated to the surface, I couldn't get anything
like that. And, it just was not in the realm of material properties, and I
tried a lot of them. Even increasing the yield to the maximum credible yield,
and going to extreme material properties I could not get a match to that kind
of a signal.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That merely illustrates the
deficiencies of your code .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You're right, and the
deficiency I found out about was that a 1-D calculation didn't take into
account a flat water table effect in the soil.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Of course not, because in a 1-D
calculation the device sits in a sphere of saturated material. So, the shock
goes out spherically, and it doesn't care what the interfaces are, except a little
energy may get reflected back, and it stays spherical.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You did a better job than I
could do to describe it. To look at the surface signals on Tybo we had surface
arrays that went off in a couple of different directions. Without those arrays
I doubt if we would have been able to unravel it. Looking at that data, you
could see that the plastic part of the wave was traveling in different pathways
than the elastic part which was just going straight through the formation on
constant rays. From that I got the idea that a 2-D calculation would probably
show the effect, So I switched over to a 2-D calculation, and I definitely saw
the effect; there was at least a factor of two between a 1-D and 2-D calculation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a Snell's law kind of an
effect. What happens is that there is a change in the shape of the outgoing
wave when it hits this porous surface. It becomes very broad and very shallow,
so it looks like the source is much deeper. That means it's going to attenuate
less because it's progressing now more like a plane wave rather than like a
highly spherically divergent one. It's still spherical, of course, but it's not
as divergent as it was, because the radius is now much bigger. The calculations
showed this enhancement, so you get a much higher free surface velocity then
you would with normal spherical kinds of geometries.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that was the first time
we had discovered that this huge variety of ground motions could indeed be due
to a focused effect from the layering. In the case of Tybo it happened to be
the water table, but there could be certainly other cases where you'd see things
of that nature. When you go from something that is saturated to something
that's highly porous, and maybe there's some strength in that rock as well, the
the signal is not attenuated very much in the porous material, and so you may
get a focusing effect.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: This effect occurs when you're
going from a medium with a relatively high sonic velocity into something where it's
slower? Or into a medium with a higher index of refraction, if you like.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's exactly the right
analogy. It tends to be most pronounced when the interface is between about twenty
to forty meters per kt to the one-third than at other distances. At very high stresses
the shock wave in the saturated and unsaturated materials give about the same
velocity, because they're so high up on the stress curve, or up on the
compressibility curve, that the velocities look very similar and you don't get
the big velocity differences, usually. If the interface is much farther out,
then the distance in which the shock wave has to change its attenuation is much
less, and so you don't see quite the effect. But around the twenty to forty meters
per kt to the one-third you can really see a pretty good effect from that, on
the ground motion. At least that's what the calculations tend to show .</span></p>

<h2>Chapter 9: Cavities and How They Grow</h2>
<br>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a nuclear device is
detonated it deposits a very large amount of energy into a rather small volume.
That deposition of energy produces a volume of extremely hot, extremely high
pressure gases from the surrounding materials. These generate a very strong
shock, which begins to move outward from the shot point. That shock is strong
enough that as it moves out it vaporizes some rock, melts more rock,
plastically deforms still more, and finally weakens to a place where only
elastic movements of the rock take place.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is left behind after the passage
of the shock is a more or less spherical cavity that contains the radioactive
debris from the explosion, and vaporized and melted materials that contain some
fraction of the energy released. Fundamental to the understanding of how the
containment of nuclear explosions occurs is knowledge about the formation, the
growth, and the eventually decay of the temperature and pressure of the
post-shot cavity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with so many other things in
the field of containment, direct information and data about cavity formation
and the conditions in it are extremely difficult to come by. Much of what is
believed is derived from measurements at a distance where the instruments can survive
the shock passage, from observations on post-shot reentries made through
existing or newly mined passages, and from calculations which try to match the
data and observations there are and which then hopefully give insight into
other phenomena not directly observable.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre10">Cavity Growth</span></p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the underground
cavity is an impressive phenomenon to consider. In a tenth of a second or so
the rock around the point of detonation of a one kiloton device is moved and
altered sufficiently to create a roughly spherical void that is of the order of
a hundred feet in diameter. For the Cannikin event, which had a yield ofa few
megatons, the formation of the cavity took somewhat longer, perhaps as much as
most of a second, but at the end of that time some 20,000,000 tons of rock had
been displaced to make a cavity in which the Empire State Building could stand.
The relative importance of the various mechanisms that cause the cavity growth and
formation is sti1\ debatable, although the general outline of what occurs is
gennera1\y agreed upon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patch</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I think the shock and the gases
are not equally important in the growth of the cavity, but I think it's a
matter of the timing. In some sense, initially the cavity is driven by the gas
pressure inside. That's what launches the shock. But if you look at the
calculated pressures inside the cavity, because of the r-cubed effect, the
cavity doesn't have to expand very much before the volume goes up tremendously,
and the pressure is forced to drop. And so a great deal of the motion of the
cavity is really a coasting, momentum driven motion. The fact that the cavity
pressures end up at overburden, give or take factors of two, is somewhat
fortuitous, because we've done calculations for other, partially decoupled situations,
where you don't get anything like overburden pressure in the cavity, depending
on how it's decoupled. It just turns out, for the strengths in the rocks we
have, and the way things work out, that's kind of where you end up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of where a
cavity does not end up at the overburden pressure is an explosion in water,
where you can get a tremendous overexpansion, and effectively a very low
pressure inside the cavity. It isn't smart enough to realize that the
overburden pressure around it is such that it ought to stop, and it keeps on going
until it gets to some very low pressure inside, depending on the depth and the
yield, and so on. Of course, it then gets smaller, since the outside pressure
is higher than that inside. Actually, such a bubble, or cavity oscillates in
size, predictably. So, I think it can work out either way.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: In the very early times after
the detonation the pressure of the shock generated must overwhelm any kind of material
properties or strengths of the rock.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I think that's usually the case
in the megabar type of regime. I've heard some people now casting doubt on
that, so I did some equational things that relate to the slope of the shock
velocity and particle velocity curves. Material properties make a difference
overall, but most rocks tend to look pretty much the same in that high pressure
regime. You don't see any big differences; the slopes of the curves in a
granite look very much like the slopes of the ones for a weak alluvium. So,
there's a tendency to say, "Well, they're all going to be the same./I But
there are elements, or there are different things out there, that do look
different.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What's your view of what drives
the cavity to its final size?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: My view is, and I take most of
it again from calculations, is that this enormous shockwave that's generated,
with· a very high gas pressure that sits behind it, gives momentum to the material
as the shock is traveling outward. From what I've seen in the best physics that
we know, in terms of calculations, is that the cavity pressure then starts to
decrease rather rapidly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, the rock vapor condenses
fairly early.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It condenses, but that happens
at a later time. Even , at very early times, when that rock vapor hasn't even
had a chance to condense yet, the cavity pressures are down below where they can
have a strong effect on pushing the material outward. What's happening to the
ground around the device is that you've imparted a large momentum to it, and so
it wants to go out. Then it begins to decouple itself from the cavity pressure behind
it, and about all it seems to know is that it has this big momentum, and so it
is moving out. As it continues to move out, it's encountering resistive forces,
and the peak of the shockwave that's imparting this momentum is beginning to
decay rather rapidly. Pretty soon this momentum is fighting the restoring
forces of the overburden, and the shear strength of the material, as the cavity
wall material tries to get itself into a wider, thinner volume as it expands.
Eventually, the material reaches the point where, at maximum cavity radius, the
restoring forces which are wanting to push it back are as strong as the final momentum
forces that were pushing it out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Nort, the detonation releases
an enormous amount of energy into a quite small volume, the shock starts going
out, putting a lot of energy into the rock, which then coasts out to some place
determined by how strong the rock is. Is that what you think happens?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's containment lore.
Basically, the rock doesn't actually coast. I've heard, ever since I came to
S-Cubed, the story that you start the walls of the cavity moving, and it
doesn't matter how you modeled the cavity pressure. “The cavity just goes and coasts,
and keeps going until the rock strength stops it." That's not so. Cavity
pressure is an important driver. What's in the cavity, whether it's steam, or
the rock is dry, or whatever, is an important driver, and it does control, to
some extent, how long the cavity grows. If I were to rate three things of
importance to cavity growth, one is the strength of the rock, two is the cavity
equation of state, or what's in the cavity. Three is gas porosity, but gas
porosity is an order of magnitude less important than strength, for the final
cavity size. That's gas porosity, as distinct from water saturated porosity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the cavity
region the details of the rock volumetric equation of state, other than gas
porosity crush-up, are relatively unimportant to containment. They're important
if you're doing something like trying to determine the hydrodynamic yield.
They're important there, but if you're interested in containment based on displacements
of the rock, and how much plastic work you do in the rock to form these
residual stresses, they're not that important. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre10">Cavity
Size, or Radius</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number which is often referred
to in discussing containment is the cavity radius. When the term
"radius" is used, the implication is that a sphere is being referred
to. That is arguably not the right term or implication, since cavities are only
approximately spherical, but it is imbedded in the literature and the available
data. The quoted radius is generally determined by post-shot drillbacks which are
made to retrieve samples of the once molten rock for analysis by the
radiochemists. The place where the drill first encounters the radioactive
material, if known in space, can be used to determine a distance from where the
device was before detonation. If the assumption is made that the cavity grows spherically,
with the device as the center, a radius can be defined. Both the assumption that
the cavity is spherical, and that the position of the device is the center are
suspect, and probably wrong.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The predicted cavity radius is
used as one of the means of selecting a appropriate depth of burial. Also, it
is generally thought that for a given yield a larger cavity is better for
containment since that indicates a weaker rock that allows more cavity
expansion, and therefore a lower residual gas pressure in the cavity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: One of the things I have been
interested in is cavity sizes. That is, what data do we have that might be able
to determine the volume, and define the shape of the cavity. Is it really
spherical, or is it perhaps non-spherical? What is its volume, and its actual location.
Does it float upward or downward with respect to the shot center, and how is
the volume of the crater, if one appears on the surface, connected to the
volume of that initial cavity? One of the reasons I've been interested in these
things is that they are some of the measurable phenomena of the detonation. You
can go out and see a crater in the desert. You can drill back, and find the
lower hemisphere of a cavity. These are some of the few things we can actually
measure about what happens when a shot goes off.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the other
things we would like to know, we just know very poorly. For example, the shape
of the rubble column, the chimney, under the ground is largely unknown. We have
in the past drilled into a few rubble columns in four and five different places
to try to learn something about their shape, but that only tells us about that
one, and they may be very individual for all we know. Such things we know
little about, but we do know some things fairly well, such as the lower radius
of the cavity, which we tag from our radchem drill backs.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There are three cavities that
we know a fair amount about. One is Rainier, where they did an extensive
post-shot reentry and drilling program during the moratorium. One is Gnome,
which had a standing, partially collapsed cavity, where they reentered and
could walk around in it. And one is Salmon, which had a standing cavity, where
they could lower a television camera into the cavity and look at it. The Salmon
cavity was spherical. It had what could properly be called a radius, and a
center. Gnome and Rainier were both flattened on the bottom, with a bigger dimension
at the waist than that inferred in the upward direction. Of course, there was
surely an instant in time when they were rather spherical.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There must be some era when
that was true. It is a rather fortuitous circumstances that we have in the past
often shot in quite uniform material. These shots have been located mostly in Area
3, in the Sandpile area, which has a very uniform material. It's hard to conceive
of shooting in a more uniform geologic setting.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: And yet that's an area where
there are discrepancies in what you would normally expect the cavity radius to
be. Some of those cavities are reported as unusually large.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes, there's an area in
southern Area 3, in the alluvium, which seems prone to relatively large
cavities. But there seems to be a gradation in the mechanical properties of the
alluvium in Area 3 as you move from the north to the south, which is up along the
drainage toward Yucca Lake. The larger cavity radii may reflect some change in
the material. There seems to be a general relationship between the scaled size of
the cavity and the material it was shot in. For example, events shot in the
alluvium in southern Area 3 have a K-factor, which is a relative measure of
cavity size, around the low eighties. Shots in Pahute Mesa, in the very hard lavas,
tend to have K-values of 64 or so. And so, we see a range of cavity sizes reflecting
the geologic circumstances of the shots.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Do you think it is the strength
of the material in which the device is fired that is responsible for the
variation in scaled cavity sizes?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The strength of the material
certainly has an effect. If you look at average numbers, as you move from the
soft, fluffy, low density alluviums in southern Area 3, with, say, a density of
1.65, to the medium density alluviums in the center of the valley, which have
densities of 1.8 or so, to the higher density alluviums in the north part of
the valley which have densities near 1.9 to 2.0, and down into the tuff units,
which are perceptibly stronger rock, to the very dense, strong lava units on
Pahute Mesa, you see a progression of cavity sizes from larger to smaller as
the units increase in their presumed strength.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say presumed
because we don't really measure strength, but one could imagine that those
materials are getting stronger. The alluviums are too weak to core. They
crumble apart. The stuff that we took out of some of the lavas up on Pahute
near the Houston shot are good tombstone material. I describe them as very
competent, very strong, uniform rock. As you move through this progression of
rocks the cavities tend to get smaller.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The data are scattered, but
there is a definite trend?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes. Much of the scatter is due
to measurement errors. Where actually is the cavity, for example. In the
radiochemical drill-backs you have to know where in space, or where in the
ground, you actually intercepted the radiation that marks the edge of the
cavity in order to back out the so-called cavity radius. The first problem you
run into is that this usually isn't a smooth transition from the native rock
into the radioactive melt glass. The transition is usually a meter or two wide,
with fractures and little pockets of activity mixed in. Turbulent mixing comes
to mind, though of course we've never seen that transition layer in that detail.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not a smooth,
sharp boundary, so one of the uncertainties is where to pick the edge of the
cavity to be. That's something which often has a meter, or two meters, of
uncertainty. Then there is an uncertainty as you lower a gyro tool into the
ground to try to survey in where that spot really is. Those errors build up,
and you're left with a sizable error, which increases linearly with the depth
of the shot, as to where you actually find that interface, just from the surveying.
Much of the spread we see in cavity radii, the K-values, the scaled cavity
radii, can be traced directly to our cavity radius measurement errors.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the
shots in Area 3 tuffs, which are fairly deeply buried, the average K-value for
those is around 74, 76, plus or minus 8. About two-thirds to a half of that
error, somewhere in that neighborhood, comes from cavity radius measurement
errors. And so, when you get a discrepancy for a shot, you don't know if you really
had a cavity that may have been large in that direction, or if you just
happened to get unlucky with the surveying.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For devices detonated in tunnels
it is possible to reenter, and if there is sufficient interest, mine back to
the boundary of the former cavity and even beyond, into the region where
overlying material has fallen in and filled the former void. Then there can be
accurate surveys, visual observations, and photographic documentation. Even so,
in the few cases where this has been done, determining a cavity boundary, or
volume, has been uncertain.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patch</span></b><span class="calibre10">: A problem we've always had, at
least for DNA, has been really tagging the cavity in such a way that you have
confidence that you know exactly what the cavity boundary is. In the tunnels we
tend to have fairly big perturbations because of stemming columns, and things
of that ilk. So, unfortunately, the cavity size is not known very well. It's
probably better to talk about the volume, and then small differences are being
cubed. In my mind that's a better way to look at it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An issue which I
think is important is the different ways that cavities collapse. Some of them
collapse in a rotational mode. That's a shear collapse, if you will, where
apparently there's a shear plane that forms behind the molten edge. It's a
slope failure, a rotational slope failure. I don't know how far back this shear
plane is, but our experience is that the cavity radii tend to be about ten percent
greater in the horizontal plane than what you determine by measuring down
vertically. Of course, stuff comes down from the top also, and so the exact
size of the cavity is a little bit iffy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is
that, at least to first order, all of the DNA sites we've fired in are wet
tuff, and they all are close to the same strength. So, we haven't really been
able to say, in terms of cavity growth, or cavity size, how rock strength
affects these things. I think that's an important parameter for us when we look
at the closures for the DNA experiments.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I can take a
slightly different tangent, that speaks in that general direction from a
somewhat different experience base. We've done a lot of work with Carl Smith
and the Sandia folks regarding the HE shots in G tunnel. Those shots have
ranged from eight pounds up to a ton. The second area which we worked in fairly
intensively was with Alex Morris at SRI, with fairly small shots. I think the
data, when you look at it, for that range of yields is pretty unequivocal that
strength has a very important effect on the cavity size.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it's strength in
a funny way. That is, we have found, with reasonably high confidence, that the
response of these earth materials, be they grouts, or be they tuffs, are rate
dependent. In particular, they have an effectively higher strength if there are
very high strain rates. That shows up in this data base which spans quite a large range
in strain rates, from 3/8ths of a gram charge of HE up to really nuclear size.
Over that range we have seen dramatic differences in the scaled sizes of
cavities.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think those are
reasonably well controlled observations, because we know, reasonably
accurately, what the equation of state for high explosive is, from its
initiation all the way out. And we have, for the SRI case, control of the grout
material. There is not as much control for the material in Carl Smith's work,
except to the extent that it's a homogeneous body of tuff that's relevant to
the DNA nuclear sites because the properties are close to those of the rocks
they shoot in.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tend to think of
the microphotographs of samples that show this incredible structure, and I tend
to think of the movement of the rock as being a very complicated process of
grains trying to break cementation, and trying to slide over each other, and
doing all kinds of strange things. So, I think of the strength of the rock from
a more mechanical point of view. Being a mechanical engineer, I guess I think
more that way.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role, or
influence, of the water in the rocks on the growth and size of the cavities is
another factor that is not that well understood. Certainly it has an effect.
There is general agreement that it weakens the strength of the rock, in some
indeterminate way, but how much it affects the growth of the cavity is an open
question.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: John, in calculating cavity
sizes, do you think that the principal influence is the strength of the rock
itself? How important is the amount of water in the rock?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Perhaps we're limited in our calculations
in terms of driving pressures from the steam, but I see only a minor difference
in the amount of cavity pressure that's generated with say, ten percent water
as opposed to twenty-four percent water. The strength of the material makes a
big difference. I am much happier with a large cavity, because then I make the
assumption that it was fired in fairly weak rock, and the shockwave is
attenuated. And from all these biases that come from my calculational
background, I see a large cavity as more benign than I do something with a
small cavity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I've looked at models of cavity
growth, and if the amount of water in the rock had an appreciable effect on the
cavity size you should be able to evaluate the volume percent saturation, and
as the amount of water and the volume of water in a given volume of rock
increases you should see larger cavities. I have not seen that there is any
significant dependence of the K-values, the scaled cavity sizes, on that
parameter.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When the cavity reaches its
full growth, the belief is that the cavity pressure is determined by the
strength of the rock and the overburden pressure.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes. I think you do have to add
the residual stress to the overburden pressure. But the cavity pressure is at
least overburden pressure. As far as the water goes, after full growth I don't
see a big difference in the cavity pressure, even though I've put more water in
the calculation. I do see some differences in the calculations, but not large
ones. There is a slight dependence, in some kinds of soils, where if there is a
lot of water, the water tends to lubricate it and make the material weaker.
Water can make a difference there. That's one effect that can certainly take
place. There is a tendency, in a soil-like material, to see that, but it's not strongly
connected to the cavity pressure itself.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I will put in a
caveat - not every rock does that. There was some work done by Bob Terhune, in
which he went back into the calculations, and he said, "Look, we see the
strength phenomenon difference in the cavity radius, and we see it as to when
the residual stress sets up." He decided that it sort of made sense. So, he
looked at different areas. He looked at Area 20, and by and large it looked
like things set up differently there, in the sense that the cavity radii tend
to be smaller than in the valley. In a very hard rhyolite, like the rock the
Molbo event was fired in, where the drilling rates were low, there was a small
cavity radius. Then you get into something like Baneberry, where they measured
a very weak rock, and there was a fairly good size cavity radius. The
calculations show the same thing. So, I see tendencies in that direction.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still some
outliers that I can't explain, and that I don't understand. From time to time
you get something that's enormously large, or enormously small, in the relative
size of things. I've seen that kind of thing. Given that, I think there is a
trend through all of this that does follow the strength idea. But the data are
noisy, very noisy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Nort, more containment lore.
The cavity sizes at the Test Site are all about the same, scaled of course,
since all the rocks at the Test Site have 15% to 20% water, plus or minus a
bit. Would you agree with that?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I don't believe that for a
minute. I know a lot of people believe that, but I don't believe that for a
minute. Most of the cavity measurements are from drillbacks into the lower half
of the cavity. They always take the radius measurement from some drill back
point to the old shot point. They don't account for cavity buoyancy, and even
elastic calculations will show the cavity moving up. An inelastic calculation
will show that the cavity may move up two, three, four feet; maybe even several
meters for a big shot, depending on how weak the rock is, just because of the
presence of the free surface. And for the bigger shots there's stronger
material below, so the upper hemisphere of the cavity is going to be quite a
bit larger than the smallest dimensions. Calculations have shown that. Of course,
nobody knows, because the cavities all collapse.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There was one that didn't. That
was Salmon. The cavity was reentered, in the sense that they sent down TV
cameras, and there was a nice spherical cavity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You're right, but that was not
at the Test Site. It was at seven hundred eighty meters, in salt, but not salt
all the way to the free surface. And, they reentered nine months later. I spent
a lot of time calculating Salmon, and Gnome. It's clear to me that in the nine
months until they reentered Salmon that cavity wall creped in about five meters
in radius. I matched all the particle velocity records from that event, and the
calculations that matched them require about a 21 meter radius cavity. They
measured 16 or 17 meters. I do believe that Salmon creped in quite a bit. Now, it
was buried very deep; if it's less deep, there will be less creep. Evidence
from salt mines is that the open drifts want to creep back at you.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Another cavity that was
reentered was Gnome, also in salt. It was not as uniform a medium, and not as
uniform a cavity either.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The models that work for Salmon
work for Gnome. That was a layered salt, and that may explain the shape.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: After Rainier, and after we had
done other underground shots we found that we always got cavities with a radius
of fifty or so W to the 1I3rd feet. We thought, "Ah ha, all rocks are behaving
in the same way. It doesn't make any difference what's in them."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then came some
information, first by very circuitous routes, and then directly, that the
French shots in granite in North Africa didn't make cavities with a radius of
fifty W to the 1 13rd feet. They only made three or four meter cavities, which
means a ten or twelve foot radius cavity for a kiloton. Well, that couldn't be,
so that information must be wrong. That was the first reaction.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we had a
symposium at Davis in 1964; I think it was called the Second Plowshare
Symposium. The French sent a very large delegation of physicists who were quite
willing to talk about some of the physical effects, as long as they thought it
was a one-on-one quid pro quo. They would tell us the cavity radius from some
shot, and then they would expect us to reciprocate. Well, the circumstances
were such we couldn't do that, so they stopped. But we did get some information
before that, and one of the things that was confirmed was that their cavities
were grossly different from what we had seen on the Hard Hat shot, which we had
fired in granite.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: How can that be? You had
determined that the rock doesn't really make any difference.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's what we thought. That
was the first clue, and we were not bright enough to tumble to it soon enough.
It should have told us that the conclusion we had come to about the rock didn't
make any difference was true because all of the rocks we were looking at were
mostly water. Even Gnome, which was shot in salt in '61, was four percent water
by weight, so when you put the sodium chloride and the other things into it, that
gives a material which is like twenty mole percent water. So, even the driest
thing we ever done a shot in was about one quarter water.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was going on was
that the French were firing in the Hoggar massif, which is a block of granite
that's like tombstone granite. It doesn't have many cracks, it doesn't have any
pores, so there's almost no water there. It was less than a half of a percent, and
it probably was less than a tenth of a percent. So, in their case they really
did have a shot in material with no water - a dry granite.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States,
and this is an important point, because it affects the arms control talks, the
disarmament talks, the treaty negotiations, has never fired an event in any
material that isn't dominated by water. The seismic signal, all this business
about the geologic differences between the Nevada Test Site and the Soviet Siberian
platform, or Novya Zemlya, are trivial compared to the fact that they all have
water. Whether it's granite or tuff isn't important; what is different is the
transmission path. The French really did several shots in something that wasn't
wet, and only they have ever done that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: John, have you done work on the
Hoggar shots? They are one body of experience of shooting in a very dry, very strong
rock, and the cavities there were small compared to the ones we normally see.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I've done a little work on
that. My understanding is that the Hoggar granite is a rock that is like one
unit that has not been fractured. Or ifit is, the fractures are much farther
apart than they are in the granites we have. When we looked at our granites, the
fractures were on the order of a foot or so apart.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our local NTS
geology, if you take a piece of granite and measure it in the laboratory, if
it's not fractured, you get a pretty hard rock. And yet, this material, in
bulk, is a weak rock, because of the fractures. And, it's certainly not going
to be helped any by the shockwave that goes through it. The two sites - the NTS
granite, and the Hoggar granite - give completely different answers in terms of
the cavity radii. If you shoot in something that's less fractured, then you
really are starting with a stronger rock, and you get a small cavity radius.
Compared to the laboratory data you have to degrade the strength of the rock by
almost a factor of ten, because of the rock fracture frequency. There has been
some work done in trying to get the strength from the fracture frequency. I did
calculations on one of the French shots, and I came up reasonably close to the
measured cavity radius.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Nort, there's a set of granite
data, aside from Pile Driver, which you are probably familiar with, and that's
the French tests.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Hoggar. Yes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The
difference from Pile Driver, as I understand it, is that the Hoggar granite is
very dry, and has a very low number of fractures in it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: One every three to five feet,
compared to one every foot or so in Pile Driver.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The other
thing about those shots is, presumably, that the cavity sizes were quite small
for the yields of the devices.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I know. I spent a lot of time
on that. Actually, those cavities weren't that much smaller. If you assume that
rock is completely dry, you get a cavity radius which is roughly two-thirds the
cavity radius of Pile Driver.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: But that means their volumes
were less than one third of the cavities generally seen at the Test Site.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's true, and there were a
couple that were smaller. There are a lot of stories about the in-situ stresses
in that mountain, but I can't confirm them. They're not confirmable.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some sort of
phase reversal that came out of Hoggar, in seismic motion. It can be explained
by putting in in-situ shear stresses - in other words, the vertical stress
different from the horizontal stresses, in that rock. Steve Day, who was
S-Cubed for many years, and I did a lot of work, and a number of calculations, on
that, trying to explain that. We got some good answers, but I'm not totally
convinced, because if you accept the answers on the cavity size as being
because the material is dry, then the pulse widths would be very much smaller.
Therefore the displacements would be much smaller. The displacements that the
French have published are fairly consistent with the SRI data. They're further out,
and they're a little smaller than Perret's two measurements here, but they're
not as small as you would get from assuming a very dry, very strong material.
Also, the seismic ground motions aren't that much smaller, if we believe the
yields they have given us. So, I'm not convinced of the answer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Let me greatly oversimplify
this. There are the people who say, "That rock was very strong, and it is
the strength of the rock that really determines how large the cavity can
grow." Then there are the people who say, "That rock was very dry,
and therefore there was no steam, no gas pressure to push the cavity out."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I don't like the cavity
pressure argument, because even if you accept that Pile Driver was fairly wet -
at most there was a couple of percent of water in there - the water would be
all in the pores. I'll buy the dry part as increasing the effective strength; I
won't buy it on the cavity pressure. There was just not enough water in Pile
Driver. Hoggar core samples were sent to Livermore at some time, and the actual
intact strength of that granite is very comparable to Pile Driver granite.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre10">Cavity Shape</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably the shock wave that is
generated by the detonation starts out as a spherical wave, imparting the same
amount of energy per kilogram to all of the rock around the device. If the
world were homogeneous the rock should move out uniformly and radially, leaving
a spherical cavity. How good is that simple picture? Not very, it turns out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: DNA has done some tunnel
reentries of one kind and another. What can you say about the cavities
themselves?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ristvet</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, we definitely know
they're not spherical. We find that they seem to be fairly symmetrical in the
equatorial radius when they're in virgin tuff, but they do snout down the grout
filled drifts. The cavities do grow preferentially in the directions of the LOS
drift and the bypass drift, which usually are where we have been tagging the
radius. Whether that's a function of the mismatch between the strength in the
grout and the strength on the tuff, or the high water content of the grouts so
they sort of popcorn back in, we don't know. Those are the two leading
candidates for an explanation .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have two events
where we probed the bottom of the cavity in the conventional manner. I think
the one we did on Hunters Trophy confirms very definitely that the downward
growth is less than the equatorial growth. Out the back in the equatorial plane
the radius is closer to what the radius is below.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would think,
based on block motion phenomenology, that the in-situ stress field would have
some sort of effect on cavity growth and create asymmetries. We don't see it in
the data, or it's in the noise. I think our measurements have shown that
gravity certainly has an influence on the cavity growth, and the calculations say
it should. Where the surface of the ground is does, definitely. We like to use
the equatorial cavity radius because that's the one of concern to us, and we
can actually walk up and physically put our hands on it. Well, we used to be
able to do that until the ES&amp;H of today. The "Low As Reasonably
Achievable" requirement makes it very difficult to do a reentry these
days.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad we did the
reentries we did when we did them. I think, without a doubt, that the reentries
on Misty Rain, and then the subsequent reentries on the shots that worked well
- Middle Note, Mission Cyber, Disko Elm, and Misty Echo -
told us more about how well we were doing at predicting the phenomenology that
we were trying to predict for containment than anything else. The Red Hot
reentry was invaluable; without it I'm not sure we would have ever done Misty
Echo.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patch</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The field folks have done a lot
of work to try to look at the shape of the cavity in the vicinity of the
stemming column, because that's where we potentially get unusual cavity shapes,
because it's not a homogeneous medium. We're trying to put something in the
tunnel there that fools the cavity into thinking it's still rock. How
successful we've been at that is something we're very interested in.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Mr. Patch, DNA has never fired
in a homogeneous medium, and you know that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patch</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, yes, that's true. But
when we take the tuff out of the mountain and put something else in, it's even
less homogeneous than it was. I would say that a lot of our interest in cavity shapes
has been with respect to how they've interacted with the stemming. I think
that, by and large, we've found that we tend to get preferential cavity growth
in the direction of the stemming column. We do perturb things, and we'd like to
understand why that is, and we'd like to know how to perturb them less than we evidently
do.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: John, presumably the cavity
grows in a more or less spherical fashion. Or, at least it does in the
calculations. Do you think the cavities are spherical?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There was a shot called Clymer,
which had a large opening above the device. We had three satellite holes with
slifers in them, and I could track across those satellite holes and see how far
that perturbation went off to the side. It was the first time we had ever
actually looked at the shape of the shockwave changing with distance. That
became a basis for understanding, or questioning, this idea about a spherical
shockwave. It was an actual measurement to base that question on. It was the
only time that had ever been done; actually showing the shape of the shockwave.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Did those measurements show
that the cavity, as it was growing, was not spherical?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes, but that means that the
energy, if it had gone up a line-of-sight pipe for a certain distance, was
actually forming its own cavity at that point. Now, I've been biased by
calculations I've done in past years where we've shown that things starting in
that kind of configuration tend to get relatively spherical with time. But in
the early stages, those cavities are not spherical.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: In the case you're describing I
would think of it as looking more like a teardrop.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: A teardrop, or a bottle shape.
Usually these shapes are fairly weak in terms of what stress waves start out
from some opening away from the device, and the main body of the stress down below
tends to overwhelm them at later times.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Bob Brownlee used to be in the
business of what LASL called hydro-yield. On Bilby, which was a shot of about
250 kilotons in Yucca Flat, he had three instrument holes. The working point
was fairly close to the Paleozoics. He has said that he could see from the
signals in those three holes that the cavity was not spherical; it had to have
been teardrop shaped to match his data. The shot point was close to the
Paleozoics, so it didn't grow down much, and it tended to grow up more. That
kind of a model gave a reasonable fit to his data, but a spherical cavity
didn't.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I would probably interpret it
differently. You do occasionally run into weaker rock, in the tuffs, that tends
to move a little bit faster, but not for terribly long. I would say it had to
do with the material properties, particularly strength, which can make a big
difference to the growth of the cavity. If there is strong rock below, and
weaker rocks above, it can grow more in the upward direction.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the
material properties could make a big difference, but I don't hold to the idea
that the cavity is going to, by its pressure, cause this change in how the
growth is going to occur. Some people think the cavity is being driven by
cavity pressure at late times, and I don't subscribe to that. I think it's
really the strength and material properties of the rocks that can cause a funny
shaped cavity. Those same properties can also affect the arrival times of the
shock. Some properties may cause early arrivals in the shockwaves, but yet may
retard cavity growth. But I certainly can believe a teardrop sort of cavity for
a shot near the Paleozoics.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre10">Cavity Pressure</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something which affects leakage
through the stemming and the cables, and the possibility of hydro fracturing
through the native material is the the cavity pressure, and its variation with
time. One body of work, where pressures were measured on high explosive experiments
in the tuffs of G tunnel was done by Carl Smith. For nuclear events, Billy
Hudson developed a method of measuring the pressure in the fully formed cavity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith</span></b><span class="calibre10">: An important thing we could do
on the high explosive experiments, which is much more difficult and expensive
to do on a nuclear experiment, was to mine back to find out what went wrong with
some measurement. We dug back in, recovered all the gauges, saw how good our
grout jobs were, and we learned from all those things. For instance, there was
a shot where we were trying to measure the cavity pressure. The pressure came
down, and settled at about seven thousand psi. We thought that was a wonderful measurement,
but when we mined back in we found that the pipe was plugged. So, we knew the
cavity came down to seven thousand psi, and leaked down from there, but the
ground shock had jammed the pipe closed, and so we didn't see that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was confirmed on
subsequent shots of that size where we measured significantly lower cavity
pressures. A tamped eight pound shot will generate about eight thousand psi of
pressure. As you go to larger and larger sizes of HE the pressures drop
significantly. A sixty-four pound shot will develop about forty-six hundred
psi. Thousand pound shots only developed about twenty-five hundred psi. We
believe that's a rate effect in how the material responds, and how rapidly it
responds.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: And when you go to kilotons?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You generate just over in-situ
pressure.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Billy, you have measured
pressures in some of the nuclear cavities, have you not?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hudson</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I would claim that our
experiments were the first to measure cavity pressure on nuclear shots through
any significant fraction of the entire history. In the fairly distant past
people tried to measure cavity pressure in conjunction with some other
measurement, or some other experiment. As a result it was sort of a catch-as-catch-can
measurement. In particular, they tried to measure gas in tubes that were designed
to withdraw samples from the cavity. Usually those measurements involved flow
from the cavity into the tube they were trying to make the measurement in.
Usually that tube plugged. In fact, almost all you had to do was call the
system a gas sampling system to be sure nothing came out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's more than one
problem with that approach. You have a real problem if the tube plugs. Even if
it doesn't, if you try to measure the gas pressure at the end of a long tube
you have a problem because you're never in thermodynamic equilibrium. If you
have a hot gas, maybe with water vapor in it, flowing in one end of a long
tube, it condenses and cools, and by the time it gets to the other end the
pressure is quite different from what it was at the opening.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reasoned that the
best way to make a pressure measurement would be to always have a very small
amount of flow toward the cavity. If you measure the pressure at the source of
flow, near your instrumentation package, and the flow is quite small, you could
argue that the flow at the instrumentation package is essentially the same as
the flow at the end by the cavity, and the pressures are essentially the same.
The tube shouldn't plug if the flow is always toward the cavity, and maybe you
could get a pressure measurement that way.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, that's what
we did. We filled the tube with fluid so we wouldn't have the thermodynamic
equilibrium problem you have with a gas. In the first experiments we actually
blew the fluid out of the tube, with high pressure, so we knew we had
established a flow and we would hopefully stop the cavity growth process from plugging
the tube. That worked very well, in that we got some data that at least looked
as we expected it to look. We might not have been in direct communication with
the cavity, but we were probably fairly close.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tried the same
experiment several times after that. I think we've done it successfully five or
six times now. We've varied things a fair amount. For example, we've stopped
blowing the fluid out with high pressure gas. That doesn't seem to be
necessary, and it slows the response time. Not doing that also makes the
experiment a lot less expensive. It costs a lot of money to have high pressure gas
systems around, because they can explode and hurt people. If it's a high
pressure liquid system, there's not much energy involved, and it's not nearly
as much of a safety problem.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time we
tried was on a DNA shot, and for a reason we don't understand, it didn't work.
Probably it was fault motion severing the lines, or something. The first
successful one was on a Livermore shot, and after that the DNA people were very
anxious to have us try it on another of their shots. Fortunately, that one worked
very well. Since then we have had another DNA experiment which looked
successful, and three or four Livermore events where the data looked very good.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've made enough
measurements, and we have enough data now that we really think that system
works to get cavity pressure. But if that's true, we still don't know why the
history from one event to the next seems to vary so widely. So there are still
a lot of questions to be answered with regard to cavity pressure.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You describe the data as
varying widely from shot to shot. What does the pressure history look like? There
is the containment lore from the fifties and sixties that the cavity expands until
the cavity pressure is about equal to overburden pressure, and then it
gradually decays through various cooling processes. Do you see anything like
that?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hudson</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What we think is happening is
that there is a sort of a plateau pressure, a constant pressure that is
established after cavity growth, which then stays fairly constant for a while,
probably due to ablation, mass addition, and so on. The energy per unit volume
probably stays constant as long as nothing is leaking out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When you say it stays constant
for a while, how long is that? Seconds, minutes, hours?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hudson</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's one of the things that
varies. On some events it's been minutes. On Cornucopia, on the other hand, it
was more like hours. The period during which the pressure is more or less constant
varies considerably. And, the plateau pressure itself varies considerably.
We've seen it both well below and well above what we thought the overburden
pressure was. We don't have a model yet.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Perhaps the reason you don't
have a model is because there is no good model of cavity growth, in the
following sense. Cavities that have been reentered are not spherical. They are
not the shape that you see on viewgraphs where the predicted cavity has been
drawn with a compass. Cavities are lumpy, and some of them are sort of flat,
and so on. On Rainier they did a lot of postshot reentry work, and there was a
very lumpy looking cavity. And so was the Gnome cavity. Maybe you don't know
what the cavity volume and shape is on the various shots.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hudson</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That may be the answer. The
surface to volume ratio may be important. And as you suggest, the contour of
the surface may be such that on some events you may have a much greater surface
to volume ratio than on others, and consequently you have different cooling
phenomena. I don't know.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the reason
it's so interesting, and puzzling at the same time, is that cavity growth and
cavity pressure are the source function for the gas we're trying to contain.
Yet for decades we basically have ignored this part of the problem, in terms of
modeling. We've made very little progress. We have very little new information,
because we've made only feeble attempts to get new information concerning
cavity growth and cavity pressure.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, cavities are different,
and perhaps that's why your results are different from shot to shot. How
different? Shape, almost certainly. As you said, surface to volume ratio. And
then there are people who say that as the cavity is growing the material is
moving out radially, and stretching tangentially, the pressure is high, and
during that time many hydrofractures are driven out from the cavity. They don't
extend a long way, a couple of cavity radii or so at most. But that exposes a
large surface of cold rock, and that cools down the cavity, dropping the
pressure. A person coming from that point of view might say that the rocks in
different places have different fracture susceptibilities, and so, different
energy loss histories. And therefore, different pressure histories.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hudson</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That might very well be.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre10">Cavity Temperature</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature of the cavity
starts at a very high value, a million degrees or so, but it drops very rapidly
as the cavity expands. The only real information on the temperature and its
time history is derived from examining the detonation products that are separated
at different times from the main body of the material in the cavity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: At the very high temperatures
very near the explosion the transport of energy is very rapid. In other words,
after the shock has gone by the particle velocities are high enough that there
is rapid communication of temperature and pressure between the center of the
expanding gas and its more outward regions. That goes on for some fair part of
the first part of the cavity growth. So, the temperature in the cavity gas goes
down to some temperature that is considerably less than the electron volt, or
the ten thousand degrees, that many of the calculators are fond of putting on
their pressure versus time charts.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that's a
misleading kind of calculation. All of the evidence from the cavity
radiochemistry - from the fractionation of the various radiochemical species in
recovered products - points to the fact that the temperature in the cavity, by
the time the rebound occurs, which is, let's say, in the time between
milliseconds and seconds, has decreased to the point where it's not much above the
melting point of the rock. It's certainly below the point where there's any
rock vapor left.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's important,
because it fixes the maximum threat. The dynamic phase is going on as the shock
wave passes out and leaves this hot stuff behind. The rebound comes back, and
that happens within a few hundred milliseconds. Because of the rapid exchange of
energy in the cavity up to that time, things have cooled until it's pretty much
in equilibrium; the energy is distributed throughout everything that's within
that cavity radius. My argument has been that the initial temperature, for
calculations, can't be much different than the vaporization temperature of the
rock. If it were higher more rock would vaporize until it did reach the
temperature of vaporization.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That seems to be a reasonable
argument.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: But it's hard for people who do
one-dimensional calculations to accept, because the inside zone in their
calculations is always at ten electron volts, which is a hundred thousand
degrees, after the cavity expands. The reason it doesn't stay that way is that anything
that is at ten electron volts is very reactive. It's going to go out and heat
up the next thing that's nine electron volts, or one electron volt, and that
time is short compared to a few hundred milliseconds.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty with
this whole discussion, from a physics standpoint, is that energy transport in
this region of, say, two-tenths of an electron volt, or three-tenths of an
electron volt, is something no one wants to deal with. The times, the
opacities, the reactions that are going on as things recombine, and you get
ionized states, and sometimes molecules that are two or three electrons
deficient are all things that are not easily calculable. In fact, they are
pretty much, as a general rule, unknown. So, nobody wants to calculate it
because nobody likes to work on a problem that doesn't have a nice solution.
Scientists don't like non-solutions.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that all of
the evidence points to the fact that by two hundred milliseconds, or even one
hundred more likely, the cavity has cooled to about two thousand degrees
Kelvin. As the cavity is cooling down, the pressure is dropping, and so
everything is cool enough that the cavity gases don't have enough pressure to
drive fractures .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one more
phase. The wall of the cavity has a huge temperature gradient in it, and I
believe that what happens is that the water in the rockock volatilizes and pops
pieces of the rockback into the cavity, causing further cooling down. The
pop-back is where the water that is caught in the pores turns to steam and expands.
Water going from water at one cubic centimeter per gram goes to twenty cubic
centimeters per gram if it goes from three hundred degrees Kelvin to four
hundred degrees Kelvin. And that's considerably below the two thousand degrees
that might be only a few centimeters away. So, I believe that there is a period
of exfoliation that's quite rapid, occurring after the first hundred or so milliseconds,
but before a second.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure doesn't
change much, because you're adding more mass and more molecules. The
temperature goes down because you're taking energy out of the molecules in the
cavity and warming the incoming material until it's in equilibrium. The glass has
fallen to the bottom of the cavity, together with a lot of rubble, and it's now
at about the melting point of the rock, between about eight hundred and a
thousand degrees centigrade. And that is the cavity we explore when we go back
in and drill or mine.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime a lot later,
and it is an unstable thing, the roof of the cavity just falls in. It might
even start to fall in when that first pop-off of the water vapor in the water
pores occurs. I f the rebound has been strong enough so there is an arch
formed, then it will stay there for a while, whether an hour or a day, I don't
know. If that arch is not very strong, especially in alluvium, I think the
blow-off of the popcorn might very well start the chimney. If it's real close
to the surface, that's what happens. And that's why we see, in certain other
kinds of special circumstances, where you have reflecting surfaces nearby, very
early collapse, in a few minutes. Those are the cases where the cavity collapse
is initiated by the blow-off of the water in the cavity walls, and those are
really dangerous, because the pressure is still fairly high.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal9">Where Does All That Material Go?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: John, when a detonation occurs,
a big cavity forms. What happened to all the material that used to be in the
cavity?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: In our calculations it's
displaced outward. We see positive outward displacement. So, you've taken this
volume and you've distributed it. If the material has porosity in it, which it usually
does, some of the volume is taken up in crushing that out. Although, when I run
a completely saturated calculation I still get a cavity of about the same size.
The calculations tend to show some positive displacement everywhere. The
material has to be either compressed, or move out. I think the outward motion
is mostly where it goes, instead of in crushing the material. And, the surface can
move up just a little. There are some cases, though, where it looks as though
you're moving out material to make the cavity, and then the surface is lower
too. So, yes, where does all that material go?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a shot we
fired, called Carpetbag. From the gauges, the surface was displaced down,
compared to where it was before the shot. That's always been a mystery. I tried
to deal with that, and I was unable to get the gauges to match the big negative
displacement fairly close to the cavity. I didn't see that in the calculations.
Another thing that happened on Carpetbag is that the surface kept sinking for
many months after the shot. It was quite an interesting phenomenon. I don't
think we've seen anything quite like that in other areas.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carpetbag was below
the water table, and so the material was wet. I think the material must have
been a matrix which was quite wet and quite weak, and that just the slightest
hit from anything would have let that matrix rearrange, and relieve that whole area.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Dan, where do you think all the
material that was in the cavity goes? Cavities are pretty large. Even for a
kiloton or so you could put this building in the cavity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patch</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Let me say where it doesn't
seem to go. One can easily imagine what you do when you grow the cavity is
basically to crush the rock out to some radius. That seems to be a reasonable
picture for something that's got a lot of air voids in it; dry alluvium, or something
of that sort. But, our experience in wet tuff is that if you go in and take
samples post-shot it's very hard to see that you have what I will call a
completely compacted region, even quite close to the shot .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have seen,
certainly on some events, where it looks like you're getting this air void
back. Preshot you have a one percent air void. Post-shot you get these samples
out and you measure them, and they still have one percent air voids. You ask
yourself, "How can this be?" It's a very strange thing to have
happen. But if you look at the details of the crush curve, you'll see that this
one percent air void only takes a little load to crush it out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terra Tek has done
some beautiful work where they've looked with this technique of injecting metal
into the open pore space, and then etching the sample and looking at it with a
laser. It's very interesting work, and you can see that what has happened to
the rock is that the stresses have generated lots and lots of very fine fractures,
so when you take the sample out of the ground there's a tendency for these little
fractures to open up a little. It doesn't have to be much to get the one
percent back, although that's a different kind of air void. So I think the rock
actually does take up some of the cavity volume, but it's darn hard to prove
from the data.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think anybody
can conclusively say, "Yes, see, this rock used to be one percent air
voids, and now it's smashed." But we do have suggestions that there is
some cavity growth that is accommodated by the crushing of the material. I
think what you basically do is you deform the material around the cavity, and
because of the r-cubed effect it turns out once you get a little ways away from
the cavity you're talking about a very small amount of deformation over an
enormous amount of material. The cavity has a lot of volume, but how much more
volume do you have when you go out three or four cavity radii.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Rainier
event there were extensive reentry observations made. From observations made in
early 1961 Ross Wadman and Bill Richards (UCRL 6586, July 1961, Postshot Geologic
Studies of Excavations Below Rainier Ground Zero) made this comment:
"Block movement rather than rock compression accounts for the rock
displaced from the cavity. The rock moved radially away from ground zero along
shock produced shears that, in many cases, were strongly influenced by preshot
zones of weakness. The lithologic rock units, below the' cavity have been thinned
and depressed but not appreciably distorted or mixed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre10">Rock Melt and Non-Condensable Gases</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: A kiloton of rock melted per
kiloton of yield is a number often mentioned, but there are other numbers used
sometimes. How much rock does get melted, and how do we know that?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, the question of how much
rock gets melted is an awfully good one, and the how do we know is an also good
question. The methodology was, and is, to take a piece of rock that was melted
by the detonation, do chemistry on it, and determine what fraction of some
chemical species that is unique to the explosion is found in that piece of
rock. Then you presume that fraction represents the fraction of the total
melted rock, of which you have a little piece.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: So, if I have a piece of the
solidified melt that weighs ten pounds, and I find a millionth of some
device-produced isotope in there I say, "There must have been a million
times ten pounds of melted rock."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Right.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Isn't that rather presumptuous
of you chemists, to make such a large extrapolation?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, yes, it is rather
presumptuous, but after doing literally hundreds of samples we have found that
the answer each one of those hundreds of samples gives is essentially the same.
But not always, which is why I said that it is a very good question. It is still
an open question. However, there was a time when everyone thought they knew
that answer precisely.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: To know something precisely is
to calculate it. An experimentalist never knows anything precisely.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It's almost that bad. From the
earliest samples there were definitions people tried to follow. There were
several kinds of melted rock recovered, and one of them was called "puddle
glass." Puddle glass was defined as being a non-vesicular, black, shiny, glassy
material.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the first few
hundred samples it was found that the numbers one obtained for puddle glass per
kiloton were remarkably consistent, and constant at about eight hundred tons of
puddle glass per kiloton of fission. Or, if you wanted to be more approximate, a
kiloton for a kiloton of yield.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other kinds of
glass that were found, which were called variously chimney glass or frothy
samples, gave numbers which were more scattered. In the range that I've seen
they were from about two hundred tons per kiloton as the very smallest number,
up to as much as three thousand tons per kiloton. And I would guess that even
larger numbers could be measured if you took a chunk of rock that you could not
visually identify as glassy melt, and analyzed it by that same technique.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When you talk about determining
the amount of melt by taking a very small sample, determining what you believe
to be a fraction of some isotope that was produced, and then multiplying that
small sample mass by the supposed total amount of that isotope, you're doing
the same kind of thing you do with cloud sampling on atmospheric shots. You're
making the assumption that things have been homogeneously mixed, and that
you've got a representative sample.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's right. And the only
proof of whether that is true or not true is from internal tests. One such
internal test is to look for a fraction of the fissile material, for example,
as compared to the fraction of an external tracer, and look at the variability
of one to the other in the same set of samples. If they're widely different,
then we could guess that none of the isotopes are representative of the total.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The process is similar to what
you do in atmospheric cloud sampling, but it must be a harder problem. When you
sample a cloud after an atmospheric detonation, you're only trying to determine
the bomb fraction; you're not trying to determine the size of the cloud. Here
you're trying to determine the size of the cloud, as it were.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes. But while the numbers
weren't published often, we also determined the size of the cloud in atmospheric
testing. And, a rather surprising number is that a kiloton of lofted material per
kiloton of yield is valid for an atmospheric burst, as long as the fireball
touches the ground. That was an astounding discovery.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You're beginning to sound as
though a kiloton per kiloton is a magical number.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes, it almost sounds that way.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning of
underground testing we used symmetrically placed tracers in the ground zero
room. We put them at the corners of a cube, or perhaps an even more ordered
symmetry than that. We put them at points representing the faces and corners of
a cubic array, for example. We found there were exceptions to perfect mixing
for very small yields. But at about one or two kilotons and above, it really
didn't make any difference if we put in six tracers, or one, or four. We got
essentially uniform mixing.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implication of
all that is, there is a mixing of vaporized material in the early cavity, while
it's growing. The particle velocities are very high, and the particles in the
growing cavity make many, many transits across the gaseous region before it
stabilizes and starts to condense. If that weren't true, putting a tracer on
two sides of the device would give different results in the two directions in
the final cavity, and that was never seen on larger yields. On very small
yields we did find pronounced asymmetries.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 1960's we
did experiments where we had open holes below the device, to try to separate
the radioactive debris from the center of energy. We even built rather
unsophisticated reflectors, and those were successful to a degree. But if you
think about it a little bit, if you deflect all these very hot fission
products, they are hot enough to interact with their surroundings and cause new
gas to be formed, which then mixes back in the direction the fission products
came from.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one experiment we
put several hundred grams of U233 in the bottom of a hole which was open to
about two hundred feet below the device. In the glassy material that was recovered
we looked for just the presence of U233. What we found was as large a fraction
of the U233, which was two hundred feet from the device, as of the device
material itself. So, the 233 bounced out of the bottom of the hole, back up the
hole, and mixed with all the gaseous material pretty uniformly. While we got a
big fraction of the total radioactivity directed down the hole, what was in the
bottom of the hole mixed very well with those things that were where the device
went off.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was implicit in
the results of those experiments was that the glass was a consequence of a
multistage set of vaporizations. That is, the initial device energy vaporized
material, and the shock wave generated from that vaporized material continued
to form more vapor outside of that region. So, simply directing the first vapor
down the hole didn't do anything at all about the material that was being
generated by the expanding shock wave. Very crudely, what those experiments
showed was that the vapor first formed was about seventy or eighty tons per
kiloton, and that the additional melting and vaporization made up the other
eight hundred or nine hundred that we observed from the total sample later on.
The surprise, I think, was that such a small fraction of what was finally melted
and vaporized was produced by the device itself. It was about one tenth, or a
little less.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The cavity is growing, and
there's some vapor in there; pretty dense, but vaporized material. You are
saying that to the particles it is a thin vapor; the mean free paths are long.
It's diffuse enough that the particles can move freely through it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The conclusion is correct, but
to think of it as being very thin is probably not correct. A better way to
think of it is as an extremely hot region where the particle velocities
initially are very high - like eighty centimeters per microsecond.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: And everything is highly
ionized. Since the atomic scattering cross sections are large compared to
nuclear scattering, if you strip the atoms of most of their electrons the mean
free paths becomes quite long.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's precisely correct. You
have particle velocities approaching many tens of centimeters per microsecond.
The vapor density, including atoms and electrons, is grams per cubic
centimeter, or some significant fraction of that, but with such high velocities
the transit time for any sensible number of meters is not long. The expansion
time of the cavity, whether it's from a kiloton or a hundred kilotons, is in
the order of a fraction of a second up to, for the very largest yields, a
second. So, when the particles are going many centimeters per microsecond you
have time for a lot of transits across the cavity, and bouncing around, and
scattering, and normalizations of the various regions with each other.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: If you keep getting consistent
numbers from the puddle glass, that also would imply that it doesn't matter
much what the original material was; tuff, or alluvium, or basalt, or whatever.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes. That was the early
conclusion, and the early experiments verified that, in a way. Our first
experiments in granite, which were Hard Hat and Pile Driver, produced slightly
less melt, but not so much so that one would say it was a different mechanism.
I believe, in retrospect, and now that we've looked at material from a lot more
sites in the tuff and alluvium, that those were spuriously obtained results. It
really isn't true in general that the same amount of rock is melted per kiloton
at different sites. That was an accident of the composition of the materials.
Ted Butkovitch and several other people have more carefully measured some of
these same numbers. They add the so-called puddle glass to all of the other
glass and ask “How much was heated above some temperature?" The usual
temperature they use is a thousand degrees centigrade. And they find that
number varies with porosity and water content.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The more water, with its high
specific heat, the less melt?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: No, it goes the other way. The
more water, the more molten material there is. The reason that's true is that
water and almost any silicate rock or compound form eutectics that have melting
points that are sharply less than the melting points of the pure rock.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our initial work
we'd always go to the laboratory and carefully dry the samples. Then we would
measure all of the things like melting points, and vaporization temperatures,
and so on. That turns out to be a gross mistake. We discovered the hard way
that when you're dealing with the earth's materials, water is an intrinsic part
of the system. To remove it distorts all of the results from that point
forward.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were things
that people had worked on for a long time that were changed and amplified by
the work at the Test Site. I don't mean that we've been that remarkable in our
science in underground testing, but it really wasn't until we began to look at the
molten rock formed by nuclear explosions that volcanologists examined their
numbers to determine what temperatures existed in the earth to form lava. Prior
to the underground tests the volcanologists did the same thing we did. They
dried out their lava samples, and said, "This lava came out of the ground
at fifteen hundred centigrade." Then, when they went and looked at the volcano,
what was coming out of the ground was coming out at nine hundred degrees
centigrade. And they found some lavas, in western Colorado, that indicated six
hundred degrees centigrade. How in the world did those volcanos produce that
molten rock at six hundred degrees when everybody knows volcanos start out at fifteen
hundred?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there were
elaborate theories about secondary melting producing two or three times more
lava than the primary vent produced, and that meant you really had to reduce
the measured volcanic flows two, or three, or four-fold, because what you saw really
wasn't the amount that came out of the volcano itself. The theory was that what
was produced was really a lot less than what you saw, but it was so hot that it
melted a lot of other rock. There were a lot of things like that floating
around in the literature.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the tuff at the
Test Site came out of a volcano. And when it came out, it came out as a solid,
even though a pretty hot solid. Some of it came out as a liquid, but not very much.
But water condensed into this hot solid almost immediately, and then it melts at
around eight hundred or nine hundred degrees centigrade. If you take the water
out of it, it melts at fifteen hundred or so. We were extremely puzzled by that
until we began to do some experiments at modest pressures, keeping some of the
water in it. And lo and behold, the more water that was in it, the lower the
melting point. And, of course, the lower the melting point the less energy it
takes to heat it to melting.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that the
amount of melt is very much dependent on the amount of water that is present -
the more water there is, the more melt, and the less water, the less melt. So,
when we said there was the same amount of melt from granite and tuff, we were looking
at only that portion of the tuff melt that made puddle glass, and comparing it
with the total melt from granite, where all of the melt was essentially puddle
glass. They turned out to be very close to the same amount, but that was a
fortuitous accident. The total melt from a a detonation in tuff, we now know,
varies with water content, and it goes from a low of about a thousand tons per
kiloton up to about three thousand. Somewhere in that factor of three, all of
the experiments that we've looked at fall.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: How could it get to be as big
as three thousand tons per kiloton?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: By the inclusion of all of the
secondary melted rock. And there's another thing to remember; the rock vapor
that's initially produced is much hotter than the vaporization point of the rock.
Much hotter. So, a little of that rock vapor can go onto a cold rock and
vaporize it too, and still the total is maybe right at the vaporization point.
The heat capacity per unit mass of rock vapor is not very different than the heat
capacity of the solid rock itself. Slightly less, but very slightly less. So,
if you have a gram of rock vapor that's three thousand degrees above the
vaporization point, it can very happily vaporize two more grams of rock, and
you'll end up with three grams at the vaporization point. That mechanism probably
accounts for a lot of the molten material we see post-shot; the secondary
vaporization and melting.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The material you find in
fractures?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes, or even in the puddle
glass. The way we get the occasional sample of the initial rock that's
vaporized by the shot is from the material that's frozen out in fractures. When
it goes into a fracture it is essentially frozen instantly. Something that
gives us information about this comes from the tunnel line-of-sight shots. When
the pipe closure fails drastically, a little tiny fraction, a solid angle's
worth if you like, of that initial vapor gets directed out a very long
distance. We've occasionally, unfortunately, seen that happen. It cools off,
and it has so little total energy that it can't cause any more melt. When you
work back, it always turns out to be between seventy, eighty, or ninety tons
per kiloton. That does kind of prove these speculations that are done from
calculations, and thermodynamics, and some other arguments are correct.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When you say seventy, or
eighty, or ninety tons per kiloton, you mean that's the initial amount of vapor
that's produced directly from the device itself?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Right. That's the initial rock
vapor. Of course, the device doesn't really make much contribution to that
mass. In the early days we used to say that we could approximate the device by putting
a ton of iron where the device was, and that was a good approximation. If you
mix in all of the construction materials and the canister in with the device,
that's about a ton. And if you mix the molecular weights, starting with
ninety-two for uranium and one for hydrogen, iron is about right. It's sort of
the geometric mean of everything that's around.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: We have talked about the amount
of rock that is melted per kiloton. When that is melted, how much carbon
dioxide is produced?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, that is part, but just
part, of the problem of non-condensable gases produced by the explosion. Carbon
dioxide is sort of the generic name for the non-condensable gases produced. It's
clear there are quite a few of them, and the reason they are important is that
when we say that we can contain the explosion, we really mean that we can
contain the gases that carryall the various radioactive materials.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there are the
vaporized rock gases. They condenses really rapidly because they go from vapor
to liquid at three thousand centigrade or so, and there's a lot of cold rock
around, so those vapors don't go very far. The next least condensable thing is
water, and steam can go a little bit further than the rock vapors. When, on the
rare occasion the steam gets out it's pretty catastrophic, and it's very
spectacular. Those events are very distressing to the containment people. There
are tons and tons and tons of steam present in the cavity prior to its
condensation to water. If it finds a path out it can carry large numbers of
curies, usually on the order of a hundred thousand curies of radioactive
material per kiloton, out with it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is sort of the
last violent level of non-condensable gases. Below that, on a scale of colder
and colder condensation, there are carbon dioxide, and methane, and hydrogen,
and other permanent gases at room temperature, that are produced by the thermal
decomposition of things that surround the explosion. On some of the early tests
we observed that the test would be contained, including the rock vapor and the
steam, but that on surface collapse, or on a time scale of a few tens of
minutes, or hours, following detonation there would be clouds of radioactive
gas rolling around the region of the shot. They were invisible, but they
carried what turned out to be a large numbers of curies of radioactive gases.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, fortunately, in
all the cases that were documented, those gases were noble gases, and they are
biologically inert. There was great concern at the time that they might contain
radioactive iodine, but in spite of intensive efforts no great amount of iodine
was ever found in those gases.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You'd think there could be.
There's the iodine-xenon link .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes, and there's lots of xenon,
but almost no iodine. It's a fortunate fact of the decay sequences that it
happens that way.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we examine those
unfortunate experiments, and look for reasons for that radioactive gas, there
was first the association of certain areas of the Test Site with that
phenomenon. The next step was, what is different about those areas of the Test
Site? It was found, number one, that the bad experiments always occurred in the
alluvium, and not in the tuff. Number two, they always, almost, occurred in
regions where the alluvial material contained large amounts of Paleozoic
carbonate gravel. And the worst ones were from Area 5, which means the Frenchman
Flatside of the pass when you go out to the CP. There were others, from the far
north end of Yucca Valley; Area 2, Area 10, and to a lesser degree, Area 8. In
examining those, the presence of carbonate rocks was observed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carbonate
decomposes at high temperatures, and produces carbon dioxide, which then
displaces the gas that's in the pores in the rock, as in a sponge, and pushes
that out of the way. As soon as it pushes all of the gas out of the way all the
way to the surface, seepage will occur. [f there's enough air-filled porosity between
the detonation point and the surface, it will push out until it's expanded to
atmospheric pressure, and then it'll just stop.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Presumably there is some
association between how much carbonate rock is present, how much of that rock
is melted, and how much carbon dioxide will be formed. Does anybody know that,
or do they just estimate it?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I'd say that at the present
time it's an educated estimate. What has been measured is the temperature at
which the carbon dioxide is given off, and that is somewhat less than the melting
point of the rock. It's like six hundred and fifty, or seven hundred degrees
centigrade.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Then I would be right in
saying, “Well, if there are eight hundred and seventy tons of melt per kiloton,
all the carbonate in those eight hundred and seventy tons is going to be
decomposed."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes. A nitpicker would say it
should be a little larger than that, but not very much. The question is, where
is the carbonate rock? If you move the working point into a layer that doesn't
have any carbonate, you would say there wouldn't be any carbon dioxide
generated. That isn't quite consistent with the observations. The reason is
that when collapse occurs, if there's carbonate right above the cavity that can
fall into the hot cavity, some of that can get decomposed. But, it would be
much smaller than if the working point were in that carbonate region. So, those
little qualifications notwithstanding, it's the general assumption that the
amount melted is the amount interacting to form carbonate.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other kind of
non-condensable gas is that formed chemically by the reaction of metals with
water to release hydrogen. It could be the iron or aluminum in the canister, or
a lot of other things. One of the more exotic is boron carbide, which can
interact with water; one boron carbide can make seven hydrogen molecules. But
the chemistry is the same. It has to be in the melt region to be hot enough,
and be mixed with water, which is steam under those circumstances. Of course,
there's plenty of water around. If you want to approximate the world you take
silicon dioxide, plus water on an equal molar basis, and that's pretty good.
You're only making second and third order corrections to put in the calcium,
and the aluminum, and the carbon, and all the other stuff.</span></p>

<p class="tab"><b>Carothers</b>: Funny, Gary, that with all that
silicon around we ended up carbon-based.</p>

<p class="tab"><b>Higgins</b>: Isn't it? There is one little
fact of nature, however, that says silicon was important. That is that the
sense and orientation of the DNA molecule is identical to that of the silica in
a glass structure - I learned this fact from Bill Libby. And I maintain that DNA
got its pattern by being on a clay particle, and that the first live
reproducible virii came from clay. That is, they were organic molecules that
got the pattern, and replicated off a piece of clay.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10: Cavity Collapse, Chimneys and Craters</h2>
<br>

<p class="tab">
There are many observable things
that occur after a detonation takes place, and the cavity has reached its full
growth. At some time the roof of the cavity gives way, and the overlying rock
falls into the cavity volume. This fall of material sometimes causes the
surface to slump and form what is called a crater, although purists call the subsidence
that occurs a "sink." A crater is something that is formed when
material is ejected from an area, and there are a few true craters on the Test
Site, the Sedan crater being the most impressive example. Here sinks and
craters will all be called craters, bowing to the overwhelming majority who use
that nomenclature.</p>

<p class="tab">How and why and when cavities
collapse, what the conditions are in the column of displaced material that
often, but not always reaches the surface, and the reasons for the shape and
sizes of the surface craters is largely unknown. There are some correlations
that can be inferred.</p>

<br>

<p class="tab"><b>Keller</b>: It was in using the data bank I
had put together that I discovered the correlation between crater dimensions
and yield, and some other things like that. One thing I noticed was that the line-of-sight
pipe events always collapsed much faster than the others. And I also discovered
that there was a good correlation, if you presume bulking, between the
dimensions of the cavities, as best we knew them, and the dimensions of the
craters, and the yield.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">You would intuitively
think there had to be some correlation, except it was popular then, and even
now in some people’s minds, to think that compaction was equally as probable as
bulking during the chimneying process. Since then the subject has been picked
up at Los Alamos by Erik Jones at one time, and Tom Weaver, and Tom Kunkle, so
there have been three more resurrections of that subject. Each time there was a
larger data bank and better statistical techniques for analyzing it, but
nothing new was discovered; it was only refined. One surprising thing was that
there was an amazing lack of scatter in the fits to the data.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">The thing I always
liked about the crater dimensions was that they were the best known features.
They used to do very detailed contour mappings of the craters, and so you could
really tell exactly what the volume was. And there was a pre-shot and post-shot
difference map. Today you don't know that as well because they don't do that
before and after comparison.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">It turned out that
the depth of the crater, not the volume, was the most sensitive characteristic
of the crater with regard to the yield. The crater radius was the first order
correction to that, and still the volume wasn't. I'm not sure why that's true.
Many people tried to relate the crater volume to the yield. They got very poor results,
so they were just turned off by the whole concept, and were rather outspoken
about how you couldn't tell anything about the event from the crater
dimensions.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Craters come in a lot of
different shapes. There are ones people call post holes, others they call
dishes, and there are various other shapes. How can it be that the depth of the
crater, which seems to be so variable from area to area for equal yields, tell you
anything about the yield?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Keller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, let me tell you what the
simple relationship was. The first thing I took was a column straight down the
middle of the chimney. I took the height of that column before collapse to be from
the top of the cavity to the surface, and after collapse to be from the bottom
of the cavity to the bottom of the crater. Any difference in that dimension
before and after collapse was bulking or compaction of the rocks in the
chimney. I expected that there would be convergence of that because of the
slumping you see in craters, and also because of the collapse of the cavity
into the bottom. And so I expected bulking, and I just plotted that bulking factor,
the ratio of those two columns versus the depth of burial. There was a lot of
scatter, but it was not nearly as much as I had expected. This bulking factor
was very high for low depths of burial and yields, and it asymptotically
approached a value of about eighteen percent, as I recall, for high yields and
very large depths of burial. That was the first clue that there was reasonable
order.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">The thing that
defeats the argument about there being compaction is that there is a very clean
cutoff between events that breach the surface and those that don't. It's a scaled-depth-of-burial
cutoff, and it's relatively sharp. If you had compaction sometimes, it wouldn't
be that well defined. Basically you're forced to believe that bulking does
occur every time, and that the bulking actually limits how far the chimney will
propagate.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">Then I tried the
crater volumes and that didn't help. I looked at the crater radii to see if
there was any correlation there. Now, the depth of the crater will give you a
yield but it may be too high or too low. But there seems to be compensations to
the extent that if the depth is too great for a particular yield the radius of
the crater is too small. And so, there are skinny craters and there are extra wide
craters, but I could correct the yield I determined from the depth with the
yield from the radius, which is not so well behaved.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">The craters that form at some
long time after the shot, after there has been a collapse that didn't reach the
surface, and the area is presumably stable, have been a threat to personnel
that wasn't fully appreciated for some time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Miller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: One time we had something that
was almost like what happened up on T-tunnel a few years later, where people
got hurt when it collapsed. We had an event in Area 2, and it used to be they didn't
fence the GZ, and this hole had no fence. We were doing angle drilling, and we
were rigging up the post-shot rig. Part of our equipment were these big blowers
to suck air to the cellars in case we had a release from the drilling. This
teamster drove up to the location, and he's driving a big rig. He drove all the
way to the GZ almost, turned around to get spotted, and as he's returning the ground
collapsed. The float with those blowers went into the crater. Fortunately it
was not a cookie cutter; it was a saucer shape. Part of the tractor wheels went
into the dirt where it cracked, and the tractor couldn't move. This guy jumped
out with his hard hat and his lunch pail, and just ran like hell. We took
another tractor, or dozer in there, and grabbed hold and pulled the whole thing
out. Fortunately nobody was hurt. It was close though, very close. That was the
event that caused us to start fencing the ground zero area.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Keller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: On the accident on Rainier Mesa
with Midas Myth, when they dropped the trailers and some people in the crater
as it formed, the same order that I had found earlier for crater formation was
relevant to that event. Midas Myth turned out to have one of the smallest
scaled depth of burial for events in Rainier Mesa. Although they'd existed on
other events on the Mesa, craters had not been seen, or recognized. They were
just so shallow that they were not noticed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Roy, did you ever do any
drilling work on Rainier Mesa?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Miller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Oh yeah. There was a shot in a
vertical hole there called Wineskin, in U12r, in '69. That had a surface
collapse. The fact is, after the collapse they had where they dropped the
trailers in the crater, they said there had never been one on Rainier Mesa to
collapse to the surface. Ken Oswald took them all up there and showed them that
surface collapse.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Keller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When you plotted those events
that had been shot in Rainier Mesa, and whose chimney heights were known, Midas
Myth fit right on a nice curve. The chimney height was just right on the line,
and the chimney height would be above the surface, which gives you a crater. At
the time, the folks who thought the shots on Rainier Mesa never cratered were
not aware of the surveys that had been done, and that showed the shots did
crater a little bit. And so it was a matter of not knowing what they didn't
know. And one did not normally put trailers at ground zero. It was an
unfortunate incident. There is a lot more order to this data than some people are
willing to believe, and so within some uncertainty it's a very useful way to
look at some things, such as yield, or crater formation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">One thing that's
evolved most recently out of that is that Tom Kunkle and I looked at large
yields, and we found that some of the crater volumes were larger than that of
the cavity inferred from the measured cavity radii. Of course, if bulking is
existent in every shot, you can't have a crater volume that's larger than the
cavity volume. We looked at that more carefully, and since I believe they all
bulk and there's no reason to believe that the large yields ought to compact,
the cavity inferred from the crater dimensions is a simple constant times W
1/3rd, in radius.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">The conclusion you
have to come to is that the radius measured in the downward direction is not
characteristic of the cavity volume, and that the cavity volume is larger than
that measurement would suggest. And there are good calculational reasons to
believe that. There are calculations that have been done that show stress
gradients, and the refractions from the surface, tend to allow growth in the
upward direction. And so it's in light of that conviction, unless you're real
near the surface and you get a strong relief wave, and you crater, that
cavities really are pretty much a constant times W to the 1/3rd. Now, they are
occasionally bigger. They're obviously bigger, as measured, in the southern
area of Yucca. Not only is the measured cavity radius larger in that area, the
craters are also larger, which supports that correlation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You can look at the crater, and
you can do surveys, and you can get the dimensions as accurately as you care to
pay for. On the other hand, the cavity radius, if there is such a thing, is in fact
poorly known. They drill down, poke into an uncertain spot where the cavity
used to be, and somebody picks a radius based on some level of radiation there.
The impression I get is that no one believes those reported radii are very
accurate. How did you deal with that when you tried to compare the crater
depths before and after the shot?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Keller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I presumed that there was
uncertainty in the radii, and that the crater volumes were known better than
the cavity radii. So, I went back and calculated yields from the crater
dimensions, and there were a few yields that were way off. One of them was Bandicoot.
Since then they have gone back and re-drilled it, and found that the measured
cavity radius is larger than originally reported. There's also reason to
believe that the actual yield was substantially higher than the published
yield. And so, those kinds of things show up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">There are a couple of
events where it's probably worth noticing those differences, and one is Merlin.
Merlin is the shot from which the samples were obtained for which all material
properties for alluvium are based these days. "Merlin alluvium" - you
hear it all the time. Well, those properties are deduced from a presumed yield for
Merlin. I've never really pushed it, but I suspect that the Merlin yield as
given isn't correct either.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">It was like '67 when
I first developed this correlation, and Bob Brownlee was excited about it, or
seemed to be anyway. He took it to Charles Brown and said, "Hey, here's a
way to measure yield." And there were a couple of folks who said,
"That's just because we always bury shots at the same scaled depth, and
you use depth in there, and that's why you get that." Well, that’s not
true. If you just knew the depth you wouldn't get nearly as good a correlation.
Another thing Brown said was, "We already have Hydyne, we have rad chem,
and we have seismic; what do we need another yield determination for?" That
was his response. Well, it's actually turned out to be more useful than that,
but it was interesting to hear the logic that would prevail in those
circumstances.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The radius we measure from the
radiochemical drill back is developed by taking the point where the bomb went
off, and finding the geometric distance to where the drill hole first found radiation.
There are a fair number of assumptions there. One is that the effective center
of the cavity is the center of of the explosion. Now, there's no reason to
believe that should be true. Another assumption is that you have a spherical
cavity. Based on these assumptions, you can derive a volume.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">Many of our shots,
especially those for a successful event, have a scaled depth of burial of
perhaps a hundred twenty, a hundred twenty-five meters. Those in the valley
collapse to the surface, and make very large, nice surface craters. J've always
felt there ought to be a relationship between the size of that surface crater,
the volume of the surface crater, and the volume of the cavity. And in fact
there is. This leads me to believe that yes, in fact, by and large, that radius
we're getting tells us something about an actual radius - that the cavity is
more or less spherical, and it's more or less centered on the explosion point.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You could make the argument
that cavities are perhaps not spherical for a variety of reasons, but except
for a certain number of special cases, they're spherical enough. These one or
two meter wiggles and protrusions in the cavity wall don't amount to much. We
can average those out. And so, while cavities aren't spherical as we draw with
our compass . . .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: They may be as you draw circles
freehand, like many of us draw circles. That has been my impression of how cavity
sections may be. Conversely, I think we've seen cases, and we expect to see
cases, where the cavities are squashed by the geology. One of the things we
seem to see, when shooting over very hard material, in a softer material, or
under a very hard layer in a softer layer is that the cavity is either pushed
down when it's in the softer material under the hard layer, or squashed on the
bottom as it tries to grow down through the hard material. By and large, the
little data we have from our drill backs tends to support these models. In </span><span class="calibre10">the </span><span class="calibre10">final stages of cavity growth,
the material strength must be determining where that cavity stops. And so, in
weaker materials the cavity should be bigger.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What comments would you make
about craters with respect to cavities?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, for events that take
place at relatively small scaled depths of burial - a hundred twenty or hundred
forty scaled meters - the crater and the depth of burial together are a very
good indicator of how big the cavity was underground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">I don't think this is
surprising. At least, it wasn't to me. One would envision that the size of the
crater ought to be related to the initial size of the cavity and its depth of
burial, given the material it's in, of course. And, indeed, this is in fact the
case. There is an excellent relationship between the yield of the device, it's
depth of burial, and the depth and size of the crater on the surface.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">You'd have to improve
the rad chem yields for me to do any better in tuff, which is a very uniform material.
That was, to me, a rather surprising result. I didn't expect to find such a
good regression relationship. Now, in alluvium, it doesn't work as well. There
are evidently different types of alluvium we shoot in. More or less, the tuffs
in the valley seem, to the bomb, to be tuffs. And of course, geologically there
are not large differences between them either. That gives a good ability to
deduce actual event yields from observable, unclassified aspects, as we have
found.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Unclassified aspects perhaps,
but I have to know a lot of things. I have to know the relationship exists, and
then I have to know that this shot, whose yield I want to know, was fired in
the same material and not something else. I do need to know a number of things
in order to derive that yield.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes. The events I've been most
interested in are those involving treaty compliance for a hundred and fifty
kiloton limit. And so, the question is, can I verify a hundred and fifty
kilotons from unclassified information? After all, I know the depth of burial. I
can tell that from the cable lengths, although that could be disguised. But I
could find out the depth of the hole, to find a maximum depth of burial. I can
tell if there's a surface crater - that's quite easy to know from a satellite
or other overhead photography.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">Does this tell me
something about yield, if I happen to know it was in a tuff unit in the valley?
At a hundred fifty kilotons, if I shoot in the valley, I'm going to be in a
tuff unit, because I need that depth of burial to successfully contain the
device. Those are all the things I need to know; it is in a tuff unit, the
depth of burial, did it make a surface crater. Mostly I need the depth of the
crater, which is fairly easy to arrive at from overhead photography. After all,
we do it that way now using aerial photographs.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">From that information
I maintain I can get yields to plus or minus twenty percent, which is about the
same as the rad chem people do. And, I don't need to do more than that. It's a
very reliable way, at least to me who believes in the process, to verify the yield.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: And the reason that it works,
presumably, is that the tuff in the valley is a fairly uniform material, and
the cavities therefore follow a fairly smooth law.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's right.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: And as they collapse to the
surface, any bulking from shot to shot is very similar. So, since you mostly
want to know the depth of the crater, you must feel that's related to the size of
the cavity. In a sense you're using the crater to infer a radius for the
cavity. That's what gives you the yield in this uniform material, in which
you've fired enough shots that you have calibrated it, in a sense. Is that sort
of it?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, if I went to some
different place, like Pahute Mesa, where this rock layer is hard and that layer
is soft, and this pillow of lava is here but was not there, it might be much
more difficult.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It's more difficult, but
actually the relationship works fairly well on Pahute Mesa, adjusted for the,
Mesa because there are harder rocks and smaller cavities, and less frequency of
cratering up there. But when I adjust for those things, that is, do a Pahute regression,
it works quite well there. Where it doesn't work well is in the alluvium. I have
to know more about the type of alluvium the shot is in. We certainly see a larger
range of densities, and water contents, and gas porosities in the alluviums
than we do through the other geologic testing units. Of course, if one knows
that such a relationship exists, we have published enough declassified event
yields to calibrate the relationship.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">Let me bring up a
side issue. In studying the underground phenomenology from nuclear detonations,
I kept coming across this group of shots that were just odd. Nothing looked
quite like it should. It was interesting group. Then I found out what they
were. If you find a particular kind of device, you throw it out of your analysis,
because people don't know very well what the yield was. It just became clear to
me that those yields have big uncertainties.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">And so, one of the
things that occasionally comes up in looking at a proposed shot site is that
the neighboring experience may include some things that look pretty wild.
There's a crater there where there shouldn't have been one, or there isn't one
where there should have been, or this K value looks very strange. But when you actually
look at them, there are these particular devices, and I usually just tend to
ignore them. And there are some that are so odd that I just, when they come up,
gently dismiss them as much as I can. Very odd things happened on Alva and
Marvel. But of course, you'd certainly expect them to behave differently than
other shots.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There's another class of shots
which ought to effect the cavity, and thereby the crater. Those are the
vertical pipe shots . Generally they collapsed rather quickly compared to the
other shots. Do they follow your curves?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: We really didn't do enough of
those. There are a half a dozen or so, and they're scattered about. They're not
a very uniform group.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">As far as collapse
times go, I've never been able to predict them, so I can't say what effect the
pipes had on them. One of the last of these we did was Huron King. It was done
the summer I showed up here. Everyone was very happy that it took fifty-nine minutes
to collapse, because that demonstrated that the pipe must have had really no
effect on it. I suppose that's a good demonstration, but we had a lot of
downhole diagnostics that demonstrated it better. So, I became acquainted with
that argument rather early on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">Collapse times are
interesting, and they're interesting because we can't predict them. For some
shots in alluvium in the valley there are some sort of general rules that allow
you to tell if it is going to collapse in one hour or ten hours, but really no
more exactly than that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">For shots in the
valley tuffs, where we can predict if it will collapse to the surface, and the
general size of the surface crater, and a lot of things about the shot, we cannot
even get a handle on collapse times. When the cavity collapses seems nearly a
random process. Certainly if it happened in a minute or two, that would be very
unusual, and in fact, we haven't seen that. Anywhere from one to ten hours,
well, okay. It's been interesting that we just can't do much better than that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Do you think the water that is
present plays a strong role in the collapse?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: By itself, the water, either by
weight percent or by volume percent in the cavity region, that we actually
measure, seems to play no particular role in determining collapse time. It must
be the interaction of the water with the rock. We have shot in relatively dry
sites of four or five or six percent, up to relatively wet sites in the high
twenties. So there's some variation there, but not as much as you'd like to
have for an experiment to see any effects. But we often see, comparing
different shots, factors of ten difference in collapse times. We see markedly
different collapse times from similar sites with presumably very comparable
amounts of water. I believe that the water, or steam if you like, must play a
role in the collapse, but there's probably enough of it always present to do
whatever it's going to do.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Perhaps that's the point. At the
Test Site you rarely shoot in an area with very diferent kinds of rocks.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The collapse times, I found, go
hand in hand with another conundrum I have, which is predicting ground motions.
Ground motions display a range of characteristics which are understandable, but
not predictable.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">For example, a class
of shots that has been studied a lot is the shots in the valley in the tuff
units. Usually they have fairly high design yields. The ground motions fall on
log log plots in a very nice and uniform way when you plot them for maximum
velocity and distance. But they're not the same from shot to shot. On some shots
the velocity falls off very rapidly, and they have correspondingly very high
motions toward ground zero. On other shots the velocity falls off very slowly,
or relatively more slowly, with distance, but they don't have much velocity at
surface ground zero. It's almost as if there's an energy conservation that the
amount of energy under the curve is staying the same, but it's distribution around
surface ground zero can be very different.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">The puzzling thing is
that we can't predict for any particular shot which of these behaviors is going
to show. The motion will fall on a well-defined curve, but we can't tell in
advance what curve that is, and we can't relate the curve to any of the
geological aspects. In particular, in our tuff pile location, which is a very
uniform section of tuff geology, we have shot very similar shots in very
similar settings; same device, same depth of burial, same location in the structure.
If you had to try to repeat an event, you can't do any better than that. And
they have had completely different ground motions. And, completely different
collapse times.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">And the collapse
times aren't related to the ground motions either, by the way. I thought, ah
ha, now I'll have some way to predict collapse times, but no, that didn't pan
out. I think that both collapse times and ground motions are sensitive to the
detailed properties of the close-in geology, the geology near the event work point.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I was about to raise that
issue. The shots, you say, were just about as similar as two shots could be, in
terms of yield and geologic setting. Perhaps so. Yield, sure. On the other
hand, they were probably a thousand of so feet apart. Maybe more. So, they weren't
really in the same geologic setting, except in a general way. The details near
the working point, the inhomogeneities on the scale of the cavity size, you
don't know.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, that's true. For some
things, like the scaled cavity size, the inhomogeneities don't seem to matter
too much in the tuff units. For other things, such as the collapse times or
ground motions, it seems to matter very much, and in unpredictable ways. We
don't measure enough to be able to link the downhole measurements with what we
see happening post-shot.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There are people in the
containment community who might say, "I could believe that some of the
results you see are caused by details of the structure which you guys have
never seen. And you've never seen those details because you don't care about them,
because they don't affect the containment of your shots. However, you see the
effects when you sit down and try to calculate certain things. Some of that
detail could be things such as the motion of blocks that distribute the energy
in different ways on different shots. Even though the shot points, by your logs
and samples, look the same, they're not the same. The blocks aren't the same."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I certainly believe that block
motion has an effect. By the way, there is a weak correlation between the joint
frequency we see in holes and the collapse times. And the joint frequency tends
to increase as you move toward the margins of the valley, from the center, and
collapse times decrease as you move out towards the margins of the valley from
the center. Maybe if you have more joints the blocks at the keystone are
smaller, and then they're not as competent when it comes time to hold the
cavity up. Whatever, there does seem to be some correlation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">I think the exact
positioning of layers, and the impedance between the various layers in the
bedded tuffs plays a part. Calculation ally you see this. Calculated ground
motions and residual stresses are very sensitive to even small variations in
the layer properties you use - their thicknesses, their positioning. We found
this out on an analysis of the Cottage event, for example. The standard model
was very sensitive to small variations, and we've seen this in other shots
we've tried to calculate. So, the actual details of the geology often seem to
matter. Fortunately, not for a lot of the containment aspects.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Not for the containment aspects
of the kind of events that you do. If your Laboratory said it was necessary to
fire an event which had a line-of-sight to the surface, then some of these things
could possibly become important. But for the kinds of events that Livermore and
Los Alamos do these days, simple emplacement hole shots at a conservative depth
of burial, they obviously aren't important to the containment aspects of the
shot.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: No. Now, we may see some of
these effects reflected in some of our containment statistics. What I mean by
some of them is the effects of block motions. This is an argument that Carl
Keller has made, and I find it quite persuasive. You can imagine our emplacement
hole as actually the narrowest of soda straws. It's a pencil line when drawn to
actual size on cross sections. And one phenomenon that probably happens on
higher yield shots is block motion which is large enough to simply shear off
the pencil line. There is then no longer a line running down to the cavity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">You could say that
somewhere around fifteen or twenty kilotons we technically get block motions
large enough to shear and very effectively block off those stemming columns.
That may be a key to containing larger yield events. That's one of the reasons
they may be easier to contain; the ground motions, the chaotic block motions
close in may tend to slide the earth around and seal off the stemming columns.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">So, the cavity sizes
and crater dimensions fit nicely in a family. From that you can assume, or
infer, what may be happening in the ground. The crater size must be reduced
somewhat from the cavity volume, because of bulking of the earth materials. You
can work out a bulking factor by calculating the cavity size and the crater
volume, and looking at the difference in volumes. Now, we can work out a bulking
factor in the tuff that is seven or eight percent, but we can't a-priori know
that. I can't work that out from the mechanical models, or the physical
measurements on the tuff itself. It's something we simply observe.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">And then there's the
ground motion. We observe the ground motions and they're understandable. That
is, when a new shot is done, you look at the ground motion data. It's
understandable in the context of the other shots, but it's not predictable in
advance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When you talk about bulking
factors, there's the question of how the collapse occurs. Is it a rain of
little pebbles, or a massive chunk of material that moves down as a unit. What
do you think it is? Or what evidence is there for it being one or the other?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The only evidence I'm aware of
is from drill backs and reentries on Rainier Mesa. There are downhole movies,
and holes drilled in chimneys, which show perceptible large gaps between the various
blocks, most of the way down.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">But this is, of
course, a limited set of experience. We occasionally will drill through the
edge of a chimney, or collapsed area, during the post-shot operation. You
commonly lose circulation when you reach that region. That indicates you've
reached some kind of fractured area, but we know little of the mechanical properties
of the chimney material, such as the rubble sizes, and the spacing between the
pieces.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Weart</span></b><span class="calibre10">: We did some measurements during
the Marshmallow reentry to see how large the cavity was, how far out it had
grown. To do that we mined in until we intercepted the edge. We followed certain
bedding planes that existed in the tuff, and all of a sudden we came to an area
where, although it was still perfectly solid rock, it was disrupted. As we
continued to mine in it was clear that what we were now in was a jumble of
tuff, and it was not characteristic of the the material we had been following.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You couldn't tell from the
mining itself that you had entered the cavity region? You were still mining in
solid, competent rock?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Weart</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes. It required no additional
support over and above what we had used out in the rest of the drift. It was
tightly compacted material. I think a lot of people have the picture that when
the cavity collapses there is a rain of rocks of various sizes, and there is a
pile of unconsolidated material that makes up the chimney.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">That was not our
experience at the working point depth. Right at the cavity boundary it was
tightly compacted material. We could find evidence as we mined in of fractures
that had developed outside this cavity radius. They had had molten material
injected in them. It was usually radioactive, but not necessarily so. There
wasn't any indication at all of radioactivity at the boundary of the native
rock and the cavity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">We did contact the
cavity on more than one radius. I don't recall if we mined straight through. We
might have. We did try to determine the radius on the horizontal plane, and it
wasn't perfectly spherical. And subsequent shots, like Gum Drop, were not
perfectly spherical either.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Flangas</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When we reentered the Pile
Driver cavity, up until we hit the cavity wall there was nothing to indicate
there was anything beyond. There was a clean interface, and within a matter of
inches we were into the cavity. Now, we've had others where we see the ground
get more and more fractured, and more and more ravelly, fifteen, twenty feet
away from the cavity wall. That's in the tuffs more. But we've seen them both
ways. Ground is not homogeneous, it's not consistent.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: It sure took us a long time to
learn that. Why didn't you explain that to us sooner?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Flangas</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Nobody asked me. My job was digging
them, not figuring them out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">As far as chimneys
go, on Rainier we drove a raise up to get about a hundred feet above the shot
horizon, and that's where we ran into the material that was just powdered. It
was just totally disaggregated. It was like working through flour. Then we used
a technique they call spiling, in order to get that drift across. We wanted to
drift across the cavity and get directly over the ground zero.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: What's spiling?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Flangas</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Spiling. Spiling is a roof
support system that is used in very loose or blocky ground. Pointed (chisel
shaped) wood (4" x 6") or sometimes metal beams are angled and driven
upward and outward over the leading set with the back end braced over the preceding
set. This cantilever bracing supports an incompetent roof ahead of the last set
and keeps the miners safely under cover while advancing the heading. 50, as we
spiled across there we noticed that material was totally disaggregated. And
from my experience in block caving, that was a block caver's dream. We could
have pulled rock out of there from now on. There's a lot of material in that chimney.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Tom, there has been the picture
some people have presented of a continual process of decrepitation going on
before cavity collapse. There's the heat in the cavity, it heats up a layer of rock,
turns the water it contains to steam, which then blows off that layer of rock,
and so on. So, the cavity walls are continually flaking off.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I would expect such pieces of
rock to be quite small compared to the major blocks that would fall in during
cavity collapse. And, by and large, the cooling that occurs is from the energy
that is transported into the rock to make it hot. The conditions near the wall
of an underground cavity, following a nuclear explosion, must be quite suitable
for steam vapor explosions to occur. The rock and the water in the cavity are
under a large pressure. The water in the rock can now be superheated, probably,
to appreciable temperatures before it will flash to steam. At those high
temperatures, the flash of the superheated water to vapor can have an energy
release comparable to a good high explosive. But the energy has already gone
into it, by thermal conductivity, and so it is already hot steam and water and
rock, being added back to the cavity. The work's already been done, other than
the mechanical work, which is soaked up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">But I think those
pieces must be small. You're looking at an average size of a pocket, even the
big ones maybe, of a few millimeters across. So, you can imagine a little
droplet of high explosive detonating just inside the wall, and scaling off some
small amount of rock. I think this is unlikely to contribute to the major collapse.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">Now, there has been a
school of thought that believes that the cavity pressure is related to the
collapse time. The model seems to be that of an impermeable membrane, which
allows you to push against the rock. I've thought that a mechanism that may be
more important in determining when cavities collapse than the steam pressure inside
the cavity is the stress in the rock around the cavity. If our calculational
models are to be believed, we often reach stress states in the rock immediately
surrounding the cavity of compressive stress; the residual stress we like to
.talk about. That's also expected to dissipate, as water moves out of pores and
relieves that, and collapse times may be more related to the migration of the water
out of the combined pore spaces than to the actual pressure decay in the
cavity. The two may go hand-in-hand, but we know very little about any of these
mechanisms.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When the cavity does collapse,
whatever gases there are in the cavity have to go somewhere. The steam can be condensed
by the cold material that falls in. There is presumably only a small volume of
other gases, so there ought to be a low pressure in any volume that remains.
You might think there would be flow from the surface down into the chimney
until that volume is filled up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Kunkle</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's indeed seen in apical
voids. It's not unusual, in a subsurface collapse that extends a fair distance
up the hole, to have a containment diagnostic package survive in the stemming above.
That package comes into communication, through the stemming materials, with the
apical void. For example, on the Barnwell event, some of the upper pressure
transducers showed a declining pressure soon after the major collapse, as they
came into communication with the reduced pressure in the apical void.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">On Rivoli there was a
measurement just under the topmost plug which showed the pressure decreasing,
presumably as it came into equilibration with pressure in the apical void at
the top of the rubble column. So this, indeed, does seem to occur.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">I have heard rumors
through the years, but I've never seen written documentation, that when you
drill back into standing cavities, they have sub-atmospheric pressure in them.
I'm pretty sure we've had, at Los Alamos, events in Yucca Flat where we've drilled
back into standing cavities where there were pressures below atmospheric. They
subsequently collapsed. To my knowledge there are no standing cavities at the
Nevada Test Site.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Brownlee</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Los Alamos had at least three,
and I don't mean that there might not have been four, shots in which we did a
very low yield in saturated tuff. For us that's unusual, because low yields would
normally be done in alluvium. These happened to be in saturated tuff.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">One time the guys
came to me terribly excited because they'd had this low yield in saturated
tuff, and they said, "When we drilled back, we hit the cavity, and the
fans that do the ventilating were running backwards. All the air was going into
the shaft; all of a sudden the cavity was just sucking air. How could that
possibly be?" So I said, "The next time that happens, make sure you
estimate how much air goes in." We had three shots for which we measured
the flow of air into those cavities, and what we found, of course, was that the
amount of air that went in was the volume of the cavity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">So, we had a standing
cavity with a vacuum. What you immediately deduce is that the cavity was small,
and in tuff, so it stood. It didn't fall in. But it was sealed off, and this
told us a lot about gas flow through tuff, and how things could seal.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Subsurface collapses, by
definition, go part of the way to the surface, and when they stop, there seems
always to be an apical void above the chimney material. If that void is at low pressure,
the flow will be downward from the surface to fill up this big vacuum chamber.
That is a mechanism which would tend to militate against any release of gases
that might have gotten up that high. Do you believe that's possible, John?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Rambo</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I like that idea. We saw that
happen on Barnwell, certainly. The pressure dropped, and you could see that on
the downhole gauges. The subsurface collapse tended to draw a vacuum, and we
didn't see any radiation get above where it was measured at the stemming
platform, which was very high in the hole, about four hundred meters up. And
so, I think that downward flow certainly does happen.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">There were a set of
experiments carried out by Ed Peterson, of S-Cubed, sponsored by DNA, which had
to do with whether there was any containment threat if a shot site was situated
close to the chimney of a previous event. Data was sought as to whether or not there
might be flow of gas through the old chimney to the surface.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Peterson</span></b><span class="calibre10">: At the time we did the chimney pressurization
measurements there were a couple of things that were coming up. One was that
they were going to shoot Hybla Gold near a nuclear chimney, and they were
worried about, if they got gases from the shot into the chimney, would they
then leak up to the surface very rapidly. If you place events reasonably close
together, and if you get rapid gas flow into an old chimney, could those gases
end up going up to the surface rapidly? That was the motivation. It was a
pretty much a containment-type question.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Wouldn't it be reasonable for
me to ask, "Why would you be concerned about gases going up an old
collapse chimney? After all, there was a shot there, the chimney formed, and
gases didn't go up it from the original shot. Why would it do that from another
shot?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Peterson</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That is an extremely legitimate
question. And it is probably correct that if there were another shot, and it
didn't collapse, then there would be all the steam in the cavity, and there would
be a horrendous drive because of the steam pushing all the noncondensables Then
you could make the argument, just as you did, that the steam is going to
condense in the old chimney, because the first one didn't leak either. What you
say is true.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">I don't know all the
motivations for those measurements, but I think we are now in a world in which
not everybody who looks at the problem understands all the details of what goes
on. So, if you do a test and measure something, and say, "Okay, we did the
test and measured it. And so, now that we've measured it, we sort of know what
happens," it makes it much more believable to a large portion of the
community.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I believe that. What kinds of
things did you do?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Peterson</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The thing we did on those tests
was, we injected air slightly above the working point level through a drill
hole. They drilled a slant hole going up at fifteen degrees, from one of the underground
drifts, and came into the chimney some fifty to a hundred feet above the
working point. Through this hole we injected air, plus a tracer such as sulfur
hexafluoride. Then we measured the pressure through a drill hole that was
drilled from the surface down to the top of the chimney. We also measured the pressure
in another drill hole that came in horizontally. That one went in near where
the working point originally was. In all three of those holes we could measure
pressure, and tracer gas concentration. We also, on the surface, put out three
circular arrays so we could take air samples every thirty degrees around the
surface ground zero. Those we could analyze for the tracers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">Basically we
maintained a constant flow rate, and looked at the pressure response as a
function of time. On most of our chimney tests I believe we were flowing gas in
at about three thousand cubic feet per minute. It was between one and three
thousand, somewhere around that. Eventually, after twenty hours or so, we could
build up the pressure in the chimney to maybe three, four, five psi.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">We put in numbers of
millions of cubic feet of gas. You can model it, and we found we could model it
very well. From the model we could calculate what would happen if we let the
pressure decay, and built it up again, and so forth. So, we got to the point
where we thought we could understand reasonably well the conditions in the
chimney. We did three chimneys, and I think we did seven tests on those three
chimneys, which were from Dining Car, Ming Blade, and Mighty Epic.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">I believe some of the
motivation for using the Mighty Epic chimney was because Diablo Hawk was going
to be done in that general vicinity. I think we verified, if nothing else, that
gas doesn't come up to the surface from those chimneys.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Is that because, although the
chimney may have a lot of cracks, and the gas goes up to the top of the
chimney, there is then some amount of material from the top of the chimney to
the surface of the Mesa, and that's what's really keeping the gas in?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Peterson</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes, one can make that
argument. I believe it was on Dining Car where, when we did our first test, we
actually detected gases up on the Mesa at positions that were probably on the
order of two or three hundred feet from the surface ground zero. Subsequently,
after the USGS came out and looked at it, they found a region there that was
fractured. The fractures went down at about a thirty degree angle, and would
intersect the uncased bore hole that went down into the top of the chimney.
Subsequently that bore hole was cased, and we did another test. Nothing came up
to the surface.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">So, in that case we
really made the right guess - the material above the chimney was what kept the
gas in. I can't remember the exact numbers, but we probably put in two to four
million cubic feet of gas, and our guess is that at the most, even when we
detected it, maybe less than a hundred cubic feet had come out on the Mesa. The
tracers are very sensitive, to one part to ten to the twelfth.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">If we had been
testing over a chimney that was in alluvium, where you wouldn't necessarily get
the flow through the fractures, we would then have put some type of a tarp on
the surface, and collected the gas under it. That way. if it does ooze up over
a large region, you can still pick it up. I think that what we showed was that there
was no gross flow. These slight oozings - I don't think one can tell. But I
think the amounts would be so small that it would be almost impossible to
detect, no matter what it was that was oozing up at that rate.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The conclusion that I would
arrive at is that indeed I can safely detonate a device quite close to an old
chimney, because it is no more of a flow path than the new chimney that's going
to form.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Peterson</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I think that's true. If you're
looking purely at the fluid flow aspects of it, what you say it true.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: How else should I look at it?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Peterson</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, because DNA has a
line-of-sight, and ground shock closures, and things like that on the tunnel
events, if you do put another shot too close to an old chimney, you may affect
the ground motion in a manner that might adversely affect some other part of
the system.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: You're implying that the
properties of the chimney, of this material which has fallen in, are different
from the surrounding materials, and so you can't treat it as similar to, or the
same as the rest of medium?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Peterson</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's true. It may be a
perturbation to the ground motion. But I think from the fluid flow and leakage
point of view what you say it very true.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Do you think that would be true
in alluvium as well?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Peterson</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I think so. I see no reason why
it wouldn't be. On Pahute, Livermore has done shots where they get some
collapse, or partial collapse, and there are little fractures that ooze small amounts
of activity from atmospheric pumping. But they are very small amounts. The
thing is, you can count anything, Jim. It's like our sulfur hexafluoride -
there are just molecules that came out. With the measurement capabilities that
people have today you can measure far below anything the EPA says is
significant for anything, or that anyone else says is significant. You can
measure molecules of anything, like our tracer. And there are a lot of
molecules. It's true that Caesar's last breath is still floating around, and
every breath you draw in should have a molecule or two of Caesar's last breath.
One can mathematically show it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Carl, the Test Site, including
the tunnels, is used as a two dimensional grid, as far as siting events goes,
and there are some arbitrary rules about how far from an old chimney a new
event should be located. Eventually, perhaps, for various reasons, people could
be forced locate events closer than those rules would allow. My impression is
that nobody really knows very much about what the properties of the chimneys
are, and so they stay away from them because they don't know.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Keller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's right.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Do you think that could become
an issue in the future?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Keller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I think that if there were a
few measurements of chimney permeabilities, and measurements outside those same
chimneys, to develop real data on what the relative permeability is, inside
versus outside, then you could be much more quantitative about how close you
could get. The gas flow codes we have now would easily handle that problem.
There are some kinds of sitings that are already all right. You can shoot,
certainly, well underneath. I don't see anything wrong with dropping one
chimney into another.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: No, I don't either. No one has
done it though.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Keller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: No. Well, they've gotten close.
But I think in that case you don't have to be very quantitative to convince
yourself it's all right.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">The thing that I
think is most compelling for the measurement of permeabilities in the chimneys
is the CO<sub class="calibre17">2</sub> question. As they site in different areas, and they
encounter higher CO<sub class="calibre17">2</sub> contents, they will have to be more explicit
about what is an acceptable level. The standard five percent that has been the
threshold of concern is based on an analysis of seeps, which occurred all over
the site and includes events like Diagonal Line and a bunch of Livermore shots.
There's a whole area which Livermore uses that has a high CO<sub class="calibre17">2</sub>
content. It's also fairly well cemented. It's very important that the threshold
of concern for CO<sub class="calibre17">2</sub> is very medium dependent. If you're shooting in a
material where the chimney is not significantly different from the native
material in permeability, you can go to very high levels of CO<sub class="calibre17">2</sub>. And
in fact, some events were shot in carbonate rock; Nash, and Bourbon, and
Handcar.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Nash also leaked.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Keller</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Yes, but Bourbon didn't, and so
you wonder why. Well, Bourbon was deep enough. Seeps depend on the path, and if
it's long enough, it can even be fairly permeable. Jack House paid for some
work on the relationship of C02 and medium properties to leaks, and that will
be very useful for him if permeability measurements are made. Now, as I have
said, you can infer permeabilities from the leak arrival times, but that
assumes you know what the CO<sub class="calibre17">2</sub> generation is, and that's kind of a
flaky number. There are the arguments about whether cuttings or sidewall
samples give you a good number, and how you should average, and so on. So one
doesn't know the inventory very well.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Russ, you have said that there
are indications that things other than the simple movement of gases from the
detonation through the chimney toward the surface go on in the chimney after the
shot.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Duff</span></b><span class="calibre10">: When the early Plowshare
activity in S-Cubed came along, I had an opportunity on Gasbuggy to look at the
chemistry of a nuclear chimney. We had extensive measurements of gas composition
over time, after the shot. Chuck Smith, at Livermore, did measurements not only
on the composition of the gas &ndash; carbon dioxide and air and methane and ethane,
and so forth - he also looked at HD, HT, H2, HTO. So, we had not only
chemistry, we had isotopic chemistry. I tried to develop for EI Paso Natural
Gas, who were the commercial partner, a model which would explain all of those
measurements in a consistent fashion. I think we did, and it is a very
different model from what the Laboratory developed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">One thing that came
out of it was the postulate that during collapse some of the hot rock was
elevated, or at least not flooded by the condensate. So, over a period of six
months there was a continuing series of reactions at these hot rock surfaces
between the various chemical species. There must have been hot spots in the chimney,
and by hot I mean six, seven, eight hundred degrees Kelvin, that lasted for six
months.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's not the conventional
wisdom.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Duff</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Of course it is not. But you
look at all the chemical evidence, and ask, "How can you explain
that?" Well, I could explain it by a series of assumptions, and continuing
reactions were required. So far as I know nobody else has tried to explain why
the chemistry changed over six months. But it did. That was my first effort to
apply concepts of equilibrium chemistry to the nuclear explosion environment.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">In the DNA program
there have been a number of places where chemical concerns might be important.
We have long seen explosive gases in the tunnel after the shot. Where do they
come from?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Joe LaComb recently said they
were finding hydrogen during their reentry, but it's clean, so it doesn't come from
the cavity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Duff</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Well, I haven't thought it came
from the cavity for a long time. I've been promoting for four or five years the
idea that DNA was seeing the effects of reactions between grout and metal,
making hydrogen. Since the grout, in particular super-lean grout, is made with
desert fines, there is carbonate in it. There have been a lot of chemical
calculations which have been done, and reported, which can explain the presence
of a lot of carbon monoxide, and little carbon dioxide. In the cavities we're
dealing with there should be a lot of carbon dioxide. The stuff that shows up
in the tunnels is carbon monoxide, and right there is evidence that it is not
cavity gas.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">There is some
radioactivity in these gases, and I think that represents fission products that
get into the very early prompt flow. They get mixed into the stemming, and then
are purged out of the stemming by late-time reactions which make hydrogen and
carbon monoxide, which then seep into the tunnel complex. That was behind my
suggestions a couple of years ago of putting some manganese dioxide into the
system to try to control the late-time reactions.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I recall that Livermore put
manganese dioxide around the device canister on a few shots in the sixties.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Duff</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Jade is one. It was done in a
radiochemical context. They were trying to modify the oxidation states of
certain fission product oxides so the radiochemical collection process would be
better. Before that work came to any particular fruition, as I understand it
other chemical techniques were developed and it was dropped .</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">I've been talking to
Joe LaComb and various other people about chemical related activities. Bob Bass
was receptive, and he got Sandia to make some gas sampling systems. They have been
fielded on a couple of events now. I am professionally gratified to hear Joe
LaComb make comments as he did at a recent CEP meeting, saying that maybe, in
fact, chemistry is important. I've been saying for a long time now,
"Chemistry is a perfectly good branch of physics. There's information
there, let's extract it." So, I think there is an avenue of potential
advance which I look forward to DNA exploring.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: The only chemistry I ever hear
about at the CEP concerns how many tons of carbonate rock will be affected per kiloton,
or some brief mention of the iron in the canister, and how much hydrogen will
be produced from that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Duff</span></b><span class="calibre10">: I know. I know. Some four years
ago I got hold of a suite of gas sampling data from Livermore, and tried to see
what it told us about iron reactions, and how much rock was able to give up carbon
dioxide, and so forth. It was surprising data, because there were shots that
were right, in the sense that they had big amounts of iron around, they were in
tuff, and you'd expect under those circumstances to be a lot of hydrogen, and
indeed there was. There were other cases where there was a minimal amount of
iron, the shot was in alluvium, with relatively high amounts of carbonates,
where you'd expect carbon dioxide to dominate and it did. But there were also
cases where the reverse was true, There were cases where you'd expect lots of
carbon dioxide and instead you got lots of hydrogen. Or you expected lots of
hydrogen and you got lots of carbon dioxide.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre10">Another problem,
which is long standing, was shown in Gasbuggy, but it is also true in all of
the Livermore gas sampling. Why is there so much ethane and propane found in
the gas after a shot?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: Now Russell, there aren't any
hydrocarbons at the Nevada Test Site. There is tuff, and clay, and lavas, and
such like, but there isn't any ethane or propane. You might expect to find that
in a gas field, but certainly not in Nevada.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Duff</span></b><span class="calibre10">: There's hydrogen and there's
carbon dioxide at NTS. And at high temperatures these react, and you get
methane, a detectable and measurable amount, like one percent. And, if you look
at Chuck Smith's gas sampling data there is ethane and propane found and
reported. In equilibrium you expect that hydrocarbon series to be down about
five orders of magnitude as you go through each step. The mystery to me is that
the observation is one order of magnitude between methane, ethane, and propane.
One order of magnitude for each step, and we calculate five or six.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Carothers</span></b><span class="calibre10">: At five orders of magnitude per
step I would think it would be very difficult to see propane, and perhaps you
might not even see the ethane.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre15"><span class="calibre10">Duff</span></b><span class="calibre10">: That's right, but we do see
them. Now, I don't have the foggiest idea what the implication or importance of
that is, but it is a mystery which has been around since Gasbuggy. I firmly
believe that when we see something that is a surprise, we have a chance to learn
something we didn't know. When we see what we expected to see, we haven't
learned anything new. And so, it's in this context that I want to understand
that mystery. Not because I think it's going to be better than sliced bread, or
somehow take care of the national debt; it's not that kind of important. But I
think there may be something about the phenomenology which is hidden, at the present
time, in that particular observation. So, as a guy who is interested more in
the scientific aspects of things than in meeting the schedule, I am intrigued.
And, I think there may be something of value there.</span></p>

<p class="tab">We have a situation
in the gas sampling area, which I think is fortuitous. We are getting data, and
we've been able to pretty much make sense of it. For instance, on Mission Cyber
we were able to say, from gas samples, that in the chimney the cavity gas was seventy-three
percent hydrogen and twenty-seven percent carbon dioxide, with a little bit of
other stuff. We've got three measurements at different times, and we get
essentially the same answer each time. That's not really a profound thing, but
it allows us to investigate the whys. What temperatures, what pressures would give
rise to that answer? I wish this had happened a decade ago so I'd have some
professional time to try to do something with it. It will be the next
generation who gets to exploit it, and I hope there is somebody who wants to
champion that kind of work, because I think there is an opportunity for major
success there.
